 >The Analytical Engine was a proposed mechanical general-purpose computer designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage. It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbage's difference engine, which was a design for a simpler mechanical calculator. The Analytical Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.

And as usual with these kinda articles, it very narrowly focuses on code review as this one single activity which is tied to a branch based VCS and is done via async written messages.

People need to start considering other ways, and I'm not saying they should replace their current process completely, just enhance it.

One such way is **pairing** (and before people start moaning and saying they'd rather quit than helping out a coworker in every way possible way, I wanna get this out of the way first: nobody's saying you should sit together for 8 hours straight, nobody does that, do it for 2h max. each before and/or after lunch, and not even every day).

Another way - that isn't directly code review but makes it easier in the long run - is to constantly **educate** people. Nobody knows everything, and why it's not really efficient to keep knowledge in a comment somewhere in your review system. Have a regular session where you show and tell the whole team.

And last but not least, the kind of code reviews that the article focuses on, is **too late** for critical changes anyway. The code is already written, the time already spent or, worse, wasted.
