OneNote is kind of a superpowered hybrid between mindmaps and notes.

You have Notebooks, which contain sections, that contain pages. Each page, section and notebook have a link you can use to backlink to your preferred piece of information.
Now, instead of a vertical scroll, OneNote has, what I call, an infinite note canvas. So you can place notes literally wherever. Which is why I said

> OneNote is kind of a superpowered hybrid between mindmaps and notes.

Now, the biggest thing is it's really great to scratch out ideas randomly. So in that sense, it's a wall. For example, let's say I'm working on a paper, where I have the points I want to talk about but not all the details.

So, I just click somewhere, type out a title, and do the same for all the other points without having to wait to finish the first one.

It helps me push things forward for me because my brain runs on multiple tracks sometimes and OneNote just let's me keep it on the same wall, but not let it disturb my flow.

Idk how well that translates to you but this is how OneNote helps me. 

It's really a preference thing for sure. But in my case, it's life or death. The only reason I don't use it on Android is because the Android app sucks balls. It did before the UI overhaul, and it sucks even more now. But that's a Microsoft problem, really.",0.0,t1_iz058au,True,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>So, I&#39;ll try my best to explain. 
OneNote is kind of a superpowered hybrid between mindmaps and notes.</p>

<p>You have Notebooks, which contain sections, that contain pages. Each page, section and notebook have a link you can use to backlink to your preferred piece of information.
Now, instead of a vertical scroll, OneNote has, what I call, an infinite note canvas. So you can place notes literally wherever. Which is why I said</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Now, the biggest thing is it&#39;s really great to scratch out ideas randomly. So in that sense, it&#39;s a wall. For example, let&#39;s say I&#39;m working on a paper, where I have the points I want to talk about but not all the details.</p>

<p>So, I just click somewhere, type out a title, and do the same for all the other points without having to wait to finish the first one.</p>

<p>It helps me push things forward for me because my brain runs on multiple tracks sometimes and OneNote just let&#39;s me keep it on the same wall, but not let it disturb my flow.</p>

<p>Idk how well that translates to you but this is how OneNote helps me. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really a preference thing for sure. But in my case, it&#39;s life or death. The only reason I don&#39;t use it on Android is because the Android app sucks balls. It did before the UI overhaul, and it sucks even more now. But that&#39;s a Microsoft problem, really.</p>
