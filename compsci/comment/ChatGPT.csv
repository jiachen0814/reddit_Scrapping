First, let's review type theory:

First off, any result in type theory is extremely important for both mathematics and computer science. While y'all probably know of [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) from your discrete math classes, [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) currently competes with set theory to form the underpinnings of the foundation of mathematics (e.g. a certain kind of type theory called ""[Calculus of Constructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions)"" is the logical system that some modern proof assistant programs like Coq are based around).

Type theory is also deeply connected to the [Church-Howard isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) (""every CS concept has a Math analogue, and vice versa""), especially because the ""functional-programming"" counterpart of the Turing machine -- Alonzo Church's [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) (read: basically, ""mathematical LISP"") -- is paired with type theory to form the theory behind basically ALL typed programming languages (the type systems of most, if not all, programming languages basically fall underneath this ""[lambda cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube)"" classification model for type theories).

\---

Next, you need to cover modal logic:

Now, both set theory, type theory, and etc. are systems to typically encode [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic) (propositions, quantifiers, proofs, and truth values) or [constructive/intuitionistic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic) (basically classical logic without proof by contradiction). However, [modal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic) adds MORE (that is, modal) quantifiers like ""possibly P"" or ""necessarily P"" in order to talk about the conditional or relative truth of statements. In other words, it's like a ""logic generic over some other 'system of conditions'"" -- one application is in [temporal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic), where you can model concurrent programs and programs over time, and prove stuff about them -- here, 'system of conditions == time'.

But what about multimodal logic?

[Multimodal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_logic) adds tuples of pairs of ""possibly/necessarily"" quantifiers, all of which can be considered ""independent"" from one another -- it's like a logic with ""generic parameters"" at a systematic level.

One application of multimodal logic is to model mathematical ""belief/knowledge"" systems relative to each other. [Stanford has some good discussion on this from a philosophical point of view.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phil-multimodallogic/#NecePoss) But basically, multimodal logic is basically a ""super logic"" that can be used to model different types of modal and non-modal logics.

\---

Okay, now let's put this all together:

**Multimodal type theory** is type theory with different multiple modal quantifiers, or ""outside conditional systems intersected with it"". This is already relevant to our current functional programming languages -- [algebraic effect systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/algeff-tr-2016-v3.pdf) to model ""stateful effects"" like I/O in languages like Haskell is basically the same as [modal type theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02976).

(You can think of ""modal type theory"" as the theory behind how to precisely model state/effects within functional programs -- we currently don't really do this *that well* in current modern programming languages -- you don't normally capture all the external effects your program does at a type level, you just sort of keep that in mind with your own mental context.)

In type theory and proof theory, **decidability** (or the ability to computationally solve a problem *eventually*) is kind of a crap shoot -- you can't compute logical problems in some systems due to infinite loops or contradictions, etc. So it's important to verify that you *can* solve logical problems given a certain system.

**Here, Daniel and co. basically have proved that multimodal type system expressions can always have a ""normal"" or ""final"" form, and it can always be computed.**

This is a win for the future of functional languages, verifying the correctness of programs, and philosophy. In the future, you may be able to model different type systems (read: programming languages), programs/proofs in those languages, and how they interact with each other by changing different types of external state conditions. This means that we should be able to create a very powerful functional/modeling language and a program to solve problems with it, dealing with problems that change with respect to the actors or environments involved.",0.0,t1_j8tjxlr,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m not a true expert by any means, but I&#39;ll try give a shot at a layman&#39;s explanation, starting from basics.</p>
