<p>I get an internal server error when using the link for this site: <a href=""https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/04199500/"">https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/04199500/</a></p>

<p>Any help on this would be great, thank you!!!</p>

    })();

I would like to add a function in my existing addon.  
Currently, the addon activates a compressor only on [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv).  
Now I want to extend the addon.   


**Option 1:**  
If I am on [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) or a [twitch.tv/channel](https://twitch.tv/channel), the extension icon should show a checkmark in green as a ""badge"" (that's the little box where you see numbers for ublock) (so I know, ok it works).  
And if I am outside of [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv), like YouTube, it should show an X in red.  
That would be it.  
Here is also a page that explains it a bit, but somehow I can't get this cobbled together.

[https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/chrome-extensions-adding-a-badge-644](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/chrome-extensions-adding-a-badge-644)

\------- **ORRRRR:**   
**Option 2:**  
Namely, I would like to exchange the Twitch icon with my icon.png if the addon is enabled.  
If that is not possible, it would also be ok if I can add an icon next to the search bar on the right.  
That would be it.And if you are on other pages, of course there is no icon and the extension icon turns gray as you know it.  
(I've looked too, only this is animated and it has polygon points and co and I'm not familiar with that).

Maybe this is easier so maybe they could kindly add it to my code?

Use a bot that will scrape data once a day, i will most likely use puppeteer because it was recommended by a friend (if you have any suggestions for easy to use bot stuff that'd be great).

2048,confidence,"Hello there,

I have a freshly-made website to share my pictures as a photograph. The pictures are displayed on several rows. When a picture is clicked, it opens a lightbox which displays the picture with a better resolution. I wanted to add a functionality to navigate through the lightboxes with keyboard's arrows.

With the help of chatgpt, I managed to implement a javascript code that works well enough. Except that it works only for the first image of the first row :-) It's already a good base, but I struggle to get around that and make the feature for the other images too. If you have some hints, I am interested.

The javascript in question

    <script>
      var currentImgIndex = 1;
      var maxImgIndex = 12; // Modifiez cette valeur en fonction du nombre d'images que vous avez
    
      document.onkeydown = function(event) {
        switch (event.key) {
          case ""ArrowRight"":
            changeImage(1);
            break;
          case ""ArrowLeft"":
            changeImage(-1);
            break;
          case ""Escape"":
            closeLightbox();
            break;
        }
      };
    
      function changeImage(delta) {
        currentImgIndex += delta;
        if (currentImgIndex > maxImgIndex) {
          currentImgIndex = 1;
        } else if (currentImgIndex < 1) {
          currentImgIndex = maxImgIndex;
        }
        var lightboxSpan = document.querySelector("".lightbox span"");
        lightboxSpan.style.backgroundImage = ""url('photos/ile_jeanty/"" + currentImgIndex + "".webp')"";
      }
    
      function closeLightbox() {
        window.location.hash = """";
        document.querySelector("".lightbox"").style.display = ""none"";
      }
    </script>

And the code for the grid and lightboxes (if relevant)

    <div class=""row"">
    	<div class=""photo"">

2048,confidence,"I'll be honest I'm very new to code. Anything outside of print(""Hello World!"") I struggle with. So for the past week I've been trying to create code that would do 4 main tasks and I've been trying to do everything with the help of chatgpt but no success. I would appreciate any sort of insight or help you guys might be able to offer. This is what I'm trying to do:  


I have a set of raw data that I have to sort. First things first, I have around 260 key words. I need those key words randomized then split into sections of 13 key words. 

Then take 1 section of 13 keywords and assign it to a title and a description. Put those 13 keywords at the end of the assigned description. 

Put the most amount of keywords possible into the title until 140 characters because that’s the limit

Then I need to be able to control how many times this process can happen and how many rows it would generate on the spreadsheet ie I enter 500 and that makes 500 rows of the 13 randomized tags, descriptions with the tags, and titles with the tags until 140 characters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

||Keyword 1||
|:-|:-|:-|
||Keyword 2||
||Keyword 3||
||...||
||Keyword 260||

That's the format I have the keywords in. Not sure if it would just be better to compile them into a single paragraph in a doc or to keep it like this.

&#x200B;

|Title|Description|Tags|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Base title + all the keywords that would fit until 140 charactes from Tags->|Base description + Everything that's in the tags right there ->|Keyword 60, Keyword 18, Keyword 99,  Keyword 200, Keyword 150...Until 13 keywords in here|

You want to create a complete undirected graph to represent the network, where each vertex represents a department, and each edge represents a communication channel between departments. Each edge has a weight representing the cost of maintaining the communication channels incident to the first department ( the department you are in charge of) is equal to the cost of the minimum spanning tree of the entire network. Additionally, you want to minimize the cost of the network by limiting the cost of each channel to be in the range of 1 to K

2048,confidence,"I am building a Vue application where I have a list of items. Each of these items contain data, and I only want the items to be shown if the data is actually there.

First let me show you a bit of my code and then I can better explain what my issue is.

First I have the template, where I loop through my items and show the first 3 items on the screen unless a function is fired through a click event.

                <template v-for=""(item, index) in items"">
                  <li :key=""index"" v-if=""index < 3 || showListItem"" class=""list-group>
                    <i :class=""item.iconClass""></i>
                    {{ item.name }}
                    <strong :class=""item.textClass""> {{ item.function }} </strong>
                  </li>
                </template>

Then I have the array itself which stores both the data, as well as the styling, text and icons used.

I wll just show you a single one to make it a bit easier to read.

            items: [
              {
                iconClass: ""fas fa-arrow fa-fw fa-lg icon-class ml-2 mr-2"",
                name: 'item 1',
                textClass: ""li_alternative_text"",
                function: this.myFunction()
              }
            ]

The function is the one that handles the data.

          myFunction(){
            if(this.dataObject){
              return this.dataObject
            }
          },

Here is the issue. IF the dataObject is false, only the data itself is not shown, but the item remains on the list because both the icon and text is not tied to the data. What I want is for the WHOLE item to be removed if no data is available. So far I have tried this approach by putting the data condition inside the array

            items: [
              {
                iconClass: ""fas fa-arrow fa-fw fa-lg icon-class ml-2 mr-2"",
                name: 'item 1',
                textClass: ""li_alternative_text"",
                function: this.myFunction(),
                condition: this.dataObject
              }
            ]

and putting into the existing v-if on the template.

                <template v-for=""(item, index) in items"">
                  <li :key=""index"" v-if=""index < 3 || item.condition || showListItem"" class=""list-group>
                    <i :class=""item.iconClass""></i>
                    {{ item.name }}
                    <strong :class=""item.textClass""> {{ item.function }} </strong>
                  </li>
                </template>

This approach does not work. I tried experimenting by removing the index < 3 condition and just testing out v-if=""item.condition"". This ended up making the entire list vanish.
