More and more businesses and malicious actors want more information from end users, and they work hard to find ways to obtain it both lawfully and otherwise. Needless to say, this keeps security researchers busy patching and updating software on both sides of the battle. 

Another thing is how a lot of open-source projects work--the mentality is that there's no need to re-invent a wheel, so if someone else has provided some usable code, you just import their work into your project, and go from there.

While this is great for small independent developers who don't have access to an entire office suite of well-salaried software engineers, it also creates massively long chains of dependencies that (as we've learned time, and time again) can be huge security risks--and also cause a bunch of ""breaking changes"" that you have to handle as both a developer and an end-user who may work on a *slightly different* platform that generates weird runtime errors. 

To add to the mess, there's this obsession with doing everything as objects, and while there's a lot of value to object-oriented design, I think one of the instructors I had explained my opinion very well: ""there's literally no need to overload the bit-shift operators from C to handle iostreams in C++, it just makes the code harder to read--*and the whole point of high-level software languages is to make code easy to read*.""

From new semiconductor architectures, to optical computation, there's a lot of work being done ""at the bare metal"", and we're constantly inventing new ways and new architectures that better distribute caching and memory right on-chip with the processing and compute modules. 

If you really like that bare metal vibe, I'd highly recommend studying computer architecture and logic--if nothing else, it will improve how you think about writing software, and at best you might invent the next breakthrough technology for AI computation. *A great way to get started is by picking up a cheap FPGA from Arduino, and learning Verilog.*",0.0,t1_j8m227j,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>Well, and I would hazard a guess that a lot of it ends-up coming from the arms-race for information security.

Both are recursive functions, so you have a function `F` that calls itself, i.e. has a call to `F` inside itself.  You can talk about the difference in a lot of ways. One way is to look at what happens to the value returned by that inner call.

In a non-tail recursive function, whenever you call `F`, some computation works on its return value, `R` . Or more accurately, the function does not return the value `R` directly, for example, it might return `R+1`. A tail recursive function returns this value `R` directly ( `return F(…)`).

Why is this important? It is very easy for a compiler to do Tail Recursion Elimination or Tail Recursion Optimization (TLO), on tail-recursive function. Since in a tail recursive function, after the recursive call to `F`, you immediately return `R`, you can reuse the stack setup of for all calls to `F` by itself. This lets you avoid manipulating the stack for each successive recursive call. This saves the memory  space that would be allocated on the stack (for the return location, local variables, and the return value itself) in a very important way. It also saves running the code that would do that, but that part isn’t significant. If you are familiar with how function calls are setup on the assembly level, you can think of this optimization as reusing the same stack frame first call to the recursion function for all calls it makes to itself.

By saving this space, a tail-recursive function that calls itself a thousand times uses the same resources as a while-loop that iterates thousand times. And more notably, a thousand self-recursive calls uses the same amount of space as a million self-recursive calls.   More important is that without tail-recursion optimization, you can't only recurse so deep. Without that memory saving, it would pile up for each of those thousand calls. For some implementation reasons, the maximum size of the call stack (where this space is saved) is both limited and relatively small. 

What this means in practice is without TLO, when using recursion, you must avoid unbounded recursive calls. Or put more simply, don't recurse too deeply, or your program will crash with a stack overflow.

More important is that without tail-recursion optimization, you can&#39;t only recurse so deep. Without that memory saving, it would pile up for each of those thousand calls. For some implementation reasons, the maximum size of the call stack (where this space is saved) is both limited and relatively small. </p>

<p>What this means in practice is without TLO, when using recursion, you must avoid unbounded recursive calls. Or put more simply, don&#39;t recurse too deeply, or your program will crash with a stack overflow. A general rule of thumb is limit recursion to a fixed amount or O(log(N)) calls for objects of size N.</p>

A tail call does exactly what a normal call does except it erases the stack ""foot-print"" of the caller before the call rather than after the call returns. This also saves at least one ""branch"" which can often be beneficial with our modern highly pipelined microarchitectures.

Consider these two C constructs:

1.

   return possible_tail_call(a, b, c);

2.

   possible_tail_call(a, b, c);
   return;

In C, unless something ""allocated"" by the caller on the stack ""escapes"" to possible_tail_call (via a, b, or c, or I guess a global variable which is very gross but I guess legal) then eliminating the stack frame before the call is legal and *safe* (though may not always the most performant option).

C lacks catch/finally which might also foil this in other languages if those constructs surrounded either of these constructs lexically.

In practice, most C compilers won't eliminate the call frame like this, at least without compiler optimization flags.

""escape analysis"" can be sophisticated but it doesn't really have to be hard or just for this ""weird case"".

When literally every local variable can be (at least theoretically) allocated to registers rather than on the stack (where it's address can be taken and hence escape) then this optimization makes perfect sense and requires zero additional analysis.

Both gcc and clang will in fact often perform this optimization in these cases though not necessarily the same for all architectures or the same as each other.

In an ABI where the return address on a call is stored to a register instead of on the stack, this optimization may occur more often. When the return address is stored automatically on the stack as part of a call sequence, it might have to be moved which seems to be yet another reason  simple compliers don't want to do it.

---

While gcc/clang will do ""tail call"" optimization sometimes, some languages notably Scheme and ML ""require"" it in all cases like #1 and #2 *even if unoptimized* (or quite frankly if it produces slower code sort of...)

Critics say that all languages are Turing complete and Scheme and ML can just suck it up and fit in.

In reality clang added very limited guaranteed tail calls even when unoptimized probably because both clang and gcc suck balls at switch statements and gotos and they are throwing some bones to JIT implementors.",0.0,t1_j4umhix,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>The word &quot;recursion&quot; makes this seem fancier than it is.</p>

 Given a récursive (not tail) function :

    RecF(input) {
        if (!condition(input)) {
            return init_value;
        } 
        let partial = RecF( f(input) );
        return g(input, partial);
    } 

An iterarive version would be something like this (see the g' instead of g, because we may not combine results the same way). I also added a result function because `temp` can be more complex than just the result variable, it can hold useful temporary data. 

    WhileF(input) {
        let temp = init;
        while (condition(input, temp)) {
        {
            temp = g'(input, temp);
            input = f(input);
        }
        return result(input, temp);
    } 

 you can directly translate it to a tail rec version by putting the temporary variables in its parameters :

    TailRecF(input, temp) {
        if (!condition(input, temp)) {
            return result(input, temp);
        }
        return TailRecF(f(input), g'(input, temp));
    }

Let's see what happens with factorial function:

    FactorialRec(n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return 1;
        } 
        return n * FactorialRec(n-1);
    } 
 Transforms to:

    WhileFactorial(n) {
        let result = 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            result = result * n;
            n = n-1
        }
        return result;
    }

We need a ""temporary variable"" result to hold the partial computation. For a tail recursive version this temporary variable will be in the parameters :

    TailRecFactorial(n, result) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return result;
        }

        return RecFactorial(n-1, result * n);
    }

Finaly, because ""result"" is not an input variable but a temporary with a well defined value at the start of the algorithm, we can hide this parameter (because we don't want people to change its starting value when calling the function) by using a wrapper function :

    RecFactorialWrapper(n) {
        return RecFactorial(n, 1);
    }

Generaly, your module should expose the wrapper and keep the tail recursive function private, and now you have a optimisable recursive function \^\^

PS: some récursive functions need the call-stack because they use its behavior to store ""to compute next"" data. It is the case with algorithms like depth first search. The récursive version hides the need of a stack because it uses the call stack. For an iterative version (or tail récursive version also) you will need to explicitely use a stack datastructure to hold data

PS2: of course functions can be more complex, with multiple récursive path, with  recursive calls inside loops (sometimes their number is not even known at compile time) but there is always a translation, as you can always use an explicit stack instead of the implicit call stack and explicitely push and pop your saved states into/from it.",1674030313.0,t1_j4u52ih,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>Yes, because every recursive function can be written in an iterative style and you can translate any iterative function in a tail recursive style.
