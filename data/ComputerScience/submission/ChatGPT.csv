2048,confidence,"What a long way we have come. I remember just less than a decade ago I was playing on an old console for the first time. I have been interested in computers ever since. There is just something so nostalgic about old hardware and software. For me it felt like it was a part of me, a part of my childhood, a piece of history, it felt so great to be a part of something revolutionary.

When I look at computers now, it amazes me how far we have gotten. But I also feel so far from it, they have reached the level of complexity that all you really care about is CPU speed and RAM and GPU etc... I don't feel the same attachment in understanding what is going as with old computers. CPU speeds so fast and RAM so vast that I can't even comprehend. Back then you knew what almost everything on the computer was doing.

I recently got a 19-year-old IBM ThinkCentre. I had never been with bare metal hardware and the experience felt so amazing. Actually seeing all the hardware, the sounds of the parts and fans, the slight smell of electronics, and the dim light of the moon through the blindfolds. Honestly a heavenly feeling, it all felt so real. Not some complicated magic box that does stuff. When I showed my dad I could see the genuine hit of nostalgia and happiness on his face. From the old ""IBM"" startup logo and using the DOS operating system. He said, ""reminds me of the good old days"". Even though I am only 14 years old, I felt like I could relate to him. I have always had a dream of being alive back in the 1900s, to be a part of a revolutionary era. I felt like my dream came true.

I think what I am trying to get at here is that, back then, most people were focused on the hardware and how it worked and what you can do with it. Now, most people are focused on the software side of things. And that is understandable and makes sense.
