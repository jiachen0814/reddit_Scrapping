Chatgpt is also nice in asking for suggestion like for example when to use Action and Func and use cases of anonymous functions a/c to your project for safety and security purposes.</p>

<p>Summary:
Both works in different way and provides optimal solution if you ask we how to define them i would say. 
GithubCopilot works with you and makes you work faster and effective where Chatgpt provides you improvements and alternative methods to do your work efficiently.</p>

ChatGTP seems to be able to understand design patterns, and given an existing design pattern, generate new code for each file of the design pattern.

Basically, when you try to do more complex stuff, ChatGTP gets ""amnesia"". Hopefully they can fix this, or else working with very large design patterns won't work well.

Github Copilot, on the other hand, can't even understand design patterns explicitly  and then generate new code for them. It does seem to understand what I am doing in one file, and then when I hop to anther file, it sometimes suggests code that is correct, per the design pattern, so IT IS dong something, but many times, if just doesn't understand.

I am very surprised there is not a tool in the IDE for Copilot, to select a bunch of existing files (or reference them), explain what's inside them that you like/don't like/want to copy, and then explain new requirements, and have it build out those files, just like ChatGTP.

Maybe Copilot suffers the same amnesia issue, so it can't do it (too much information)?

GPT is ok for simple problems that can be described well in English and are working in a green field solution space.

However, that doesn't describe most problems that we deal with as programmers.  Rarely is it green field, rarely is it simple problems, and I've yet to see a BA do a good job of explaining the desired solution in English.

Often, the simplest expression of the thing to solve the problem is code itself.  ***It is easier to write code (Java, C, C#, whatever...) than it is to try to explain to GPT what the problem is and debug the resulting code.***

You'll probably before too long be able to get some simple apps up and running from it without having to touch the code it produces.  And really, that's great!  It'll free developers from working on simple problems that don't take much skill in the first place and let them focus on the harder stuff that an AI can't handle and likely won't be able to for a long time, if ever.  It'll allow non-programmers to get more work done without needing programmers.  That, too, is a good thing in a larger sense.  A small business that can be more successful because they don't need to pay a programmer for something is better for the economy, which is better for us all (doubly so if that business is providing something of substantial value to humanity - forget business, imagine a charity that can get a web site up and running quickly for nothing, it can put more donations to its core mission).

I've played with ChatGPT quite a bit.  It's very impressive.  It legitimately helped me solve a problem two nights ago that I was stuck on (a stupid mistake, as they tend to be, but I didn't see it and ChatGPT did, and I probably would have been banging my head against the wall for a while before I spotted the problem).  But it's never going to be able to do what I do at work on a regular basis because there's way too many variables, way too many options, way too much interpretation that doesn't always tanslate well to plain English, and there's too much gut feel to it all, too much drawing on past experience that it can never have because they are unique to me.  It's more art than science sometimes and I'm not convinced that can be duplicated by any AI, certianly not to the same extent of equality to a good developer.

What this means is that developers will need to upskill to stay employable on the low end.  The middle and high-end developers have little to worry about because what they offer can't be duplicated by an AI, certainly not for MANY years.  So yeah, we might see some job loss for below-average developers.  But that too isn't a bad thing overall.  I mean, it's bad for individuals, of course, and I sumpathize with those that can't keep up, but it's better for the industry as a whole.

No. No developer has been replaced by an AI. Because no AI can actually develop software. It's far from it. They can develop small code snippets, that might even work, but you can't give even the most trivial realistic technical requirements to an AI and expect it to do anything. Something like ""Add the request id to the log messages in this controller"" would be quite far for an AI to make.

And even if they do automate this level of tasks, wouldn't you be happier? Do you want to add data to log messages all your career, or do you want to build new and exciting stuff and solve interesting problems?

So far I've seen great potential of AI in solving routine tasks - write code that I'm too lazy to write. This is wonderful! Development would be less boring, which would continue the decades-long trend of developers focusing less on each bit, and more on the human-level problem they try to solve.

> but doesnt it make entry level programmers kind of screwed?

I'm teaching software development to an adult who went from 0 to junior with my help. I'm still mentoring. She's not using any AI assist in order ""to learn to write the basics"". It's her choice. But by watching her work, I've seen plenty of times where AI would remove a problem that's blocking her and let her go on her way to solve the actual ticket.

It's hard to think about multiple problems at once. For her, the problem that was slowing her down was the lack of experience and the fear of doing something wrong, so she wrote code really slowly. But once she moved along, she quickly understood what she's doing and how it looks like.

An AI would write the trivial bits for her, allowing her to focus on the actual problem. It would only accelerate her progress.

Just like today's developers don't need to think about CPU registers when writing Python, Java or C#, tomorrow's developers won't need to think about writing a singleton class.

I actually think that the opposite of what you fear will take place. In recent years I've experience a bigger focus on hiring senior programmers, precisely for having experience and knowledge to quickly overcome the trivial bits. This is what makes it hard for new people to join the industry. Explaining what software does, is actually easy. Explaining how it does it, is how you make fresh CS students fall asleep. well AI could take care of the ""how"".

<p>But once that barrier has been discarded, the shareholders will also need to be replaced by metal analogues, because the fleshy ones will not be able to explain their dissatisfaction to the AICEO efficiently enough.</p>

Well, that's a start.

But this is where the entire thing falls off a cliff.  Making websites in HTML is like playing on the beach, and then wading into the water, and thinking: ""The ocean isn't so deep.""  You're still on the continental shelf.  The minute your website has to do anything ***dynamic*** (like responding to form inputs), you're suddenly sliding down the continental slope and in ***far deeper*** water.

https://cdn.britannica.com/36/139436-004-6D745A72.jpg

At this point, you have to ask yourself how you want to respond to the form:

1. Do I want to do it on the client-side (code lives in the user's browser)?
2. Do I want to do it on the server-side (code lives on the webserver, where I put the HTML).

To answer those questions, you have to consider:

1. Is the logic to generate the responses something I want to reveal to anyone?  Is there something proprietary there that I want to protect?
2. Are the possible responses something I want to reveal to anyone?  Is there any IP there that I want to protect?
3. Does the logic require connecting with external systems (databases, other web sites, etc)?
4. Which one of these choices--IP considerations aside--is more easily learned?  But in order to answer that question, you'd have to know how to compare programming languages.

And, depending on that, you either need to learn Javascript (or some language that transpiles into Javascript)--if the solution is on the ""client-side"", or you'll need to a pick a server-side solution that works with your existing run-time (webserver + OS), whether that's PHP or Python/Flask or Java/Tomcat or JS/Node.

HTML is like decorating a kitchen.  Needing your page to ***do stuff dynamically*** (i.e., in response to user input) is like need to build an extension to that kitchen, and make sure it has plumbing and electricity and proper ventilation.  There's no ""easy path"" to doing it.

If you want something easy, maybe look into Google Forms or SurveyMonkey (not sure they have what you're looking for)--but that's not a programming question.",0.0,t1_ja6u5se,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;In regard of the actual program nothing because I don&#39;t know how to&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that&#39;s a start.</p>

<p>But this is where the entire thing falls off a cliff.  Making websites in HTML is like playing on the beach, and then wading into the water, and thinking: &quot;The ocean isn&#39;t so deep.&quot;  You&#39;re still on the continental shelf.  The minute your website has to do anything <strong><em>dynamic</em></strong> (like responding to form inputs), you&#39;re suddenly sliding down the continental slope and in <strong><em>far deeper</em></strong> water.</p>

<p>At this point, you have to ask yourself how you want to respond to the form:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do I want to do it on the client-side (code lives in the user&#39;s browser)?</li>
<li>Do I want to do it on the server-side (code lives on the webserver, where I put the HTML).</li>
</ol>

<p>To answer those questions, you have to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the logic to generate the responses something I want to reveal to anyone?  Is there something proprietary there that I want to protect?</li>
<li>Are the possible responses something I want to reveal to anyone?  Is there any IP there that I want to protect?</li>
<li>Does the logic require connecting with external systems (databases, other web sites, etc)?</li>
<li>Which one of these choices--IP considerations aside--is more easily learned?  But in order to answer that question, you&#39;d have to know how to compare programming languages.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, depending on that, you either need to learn Javascript (or some language that transpiles into Javascript)--if the solution is on the &quot;client-side&quot;, or you&#39;ll need to a pick a server-side solution that works with your existing run-time (webserver + OS), whether that&#39;s PHP or Python/Flask or Java/Tomcat or JS/Node.</p>

Bubble.is: This is a no-code web app builder that lets you create web apps by connecting different elements together, much like a flowchart. It has a wide range of features including forms, text inputs, and database storage.  
JavaScript libraries and frameworks:  
React: This is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable components and manage the state of your application. It can be used to build web apps that handle user input and can interact with a backend.  
Angular: This is a JavaScript framework for building web apps. It offers a powerful set of tools for building complex, dynamic web apps and can be used to create web apps that handle user input and can interact with a backend.  
HTML and JavaScript:  
If you have basic knowledge of HTML, you can use it to create the structure of your web app and use JavaScript to handle the user input and interact with the backend. You can use JavaScript libraries like jQuery to simplify the process of handling events and working with the Document Object Model (DOM).  
It's important to note that while the no-code web app builders are easy to use and can be a good option for quickly creating a simple web app, they may not be suitable for more complex projects or if you want to have more control over the final product.

This question ` Like if I gave them 3 or 4 different languages could they compile them together?` does not make a lot of sense at face value.

That's possible.

[DialoGPT](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-large) is a chatbot model based on GPT-2, which could be a great place to start for what you're doing, though there are also more sophisticated models available that come closer to what GPT-3 is capable of - check out [EleutherAI](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI)'s repos.

You could definitely use them out of the box, and use the Discord API to include chat history as context input. You could also do your own finetuning with whatever dataset you like - finetuning a pre-existing model is much more efficient than training from scratch, but can still take some hefty compute resources, so keep that in mind. Google Colab has a pretty good free tier that a lot of people use, but it likely won't be able to handle the larger models like GPT-Neo. If you have an Nvidia GPU, you could also set up a local environment for AI training, but tbh it's a huge hassle especially if you're not running Linux, and probably not worth it if your card has less than 8GB VRAM.

Running AI models takes a lot fewer resources than training them, so you can probably use free hosting services with things like GPT-2 or DialoGPT. I'm not sure about the larger models though, I've never created any server-side applications powered by AI so I don't really know what the limitations would be.

Also: most of the widely-used libraries for training and running AI are in Python, so definitely brush up on your Python first if you don't use it frequently. There's a Python wrapper for the Discord API too, discord.py, so that's one option for your bot if you want to integrate the AI directly.

Hope that helps! I'm no expert but I've gotten really into AI this year and it's been a lot of fun to learn and experiment with.

<p>Running AI models takes a lot fewer resources than training them, so you can probably use free hosting services with things like GPT-2 or DialoGPT. I&#39;m not sure about the larger models though, I&#39;ve never created any server-side applications powered by AI so I don&#39;t really know what the limitations would be.</p>

<p>Also: most of the widely-used libraries for training and running AI are in Python, so definitely brush up on your Python first if you don&#39;t use it frequently. There&#39;s a Python wrapper for the Discord API too, discord.py, so that&#39;s one option for your bot if you want to integrate the AI directly.</p>

<p>Hope that helps! I&#39;m no expert but I&#39;ve gotten really into AI this year and it&#39;s been a lot of fun to learn and experiment with. There&#39;s a lot you can do with it once you know what you&#39;re doing, even without paying for compute resources or hosting.</p>
