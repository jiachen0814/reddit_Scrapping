Originally, coders had to stamp holes in cardboard to trigger various instructions in the machine. This idea was first introduced by Charles Babbage in 1843, and I had family members who worked like this until up into the 1970's. 
  
The 12-bit ""PDP-8"" introduced in 1965 came with no software, but had 12 levers where you entered the various instructions and variables by flipping the levers, setting the 12-bit word, before submitting it.

Then we started seeing programming languages where you could ""just say what you want"" and the compiler will make machine code for you.

A basic web application or game today typically has hundreds of thousands of instructions and would be practically impossible to code with levers or punch cards. 

In the 80's and 90's you had to basically teach the machine what graphics are. You had to understand the trigonometry and math required to go from a table of 3D coordinates to adressing the one dimensional video memory of your computer. Making a game would often be 75% just setting up the engine at first, leaving little time for actually developing.

Today you can import three.js and start making 3D graphics in javascript with no experience and primary school math instead of university level. The library takes care of communication with your 3D GPU.

The internet is overflowing with libraries for setting up everything from databases and backend servers to front end kits, and cross platform SDKs are actually good now. The internet has set a new standard. Now, you don't have to code for the device. You code for the web, and the devices adapt.

Modern compilers, libraries and hardware has made coding so much more rewarding. What used to take years to develop can now be done in days.

Enter ChatGPT: With guidance from a human, it can speed up coding the same way compilers did with machine coding. It's really no different. It's just one more layer of abstraction, and you can always go deeper if needed.

What used to take days will now take minutes.

Look at how simple apps/games used to be.  
Look at how they've evolved with each innovation.  
Then think of how much more advanced and helpful they will be with the help of AI.

Now, go out there and learn how to be the AI master. You got this.

Your code:

Define a function that asks the user two numbers, then calculates the sum and returns it. Then print the result of the function.

This is absolutely not the same.

In a programming test it would be a 95% fail (5% for properly printing the result).

Your function accepts two arguments, but instantly overwrites them with the input so that the passed in arguments are meaningless.

That's exactly what i've been doing the last two night. And that's why i pretty much wrote a single line of code yesterday (by myself) and kept trying to see if there wasn't other possible solution i'm unaware off that would be more elegant by bombarding chatGPT with question.

As an experiment, I just asked it ""What makes Python 3 backwards incompatible with Python 2?"" and got the following response:

> 1. Print statement is replaced by print() function: In Python 2, the print statement is used to print to the standard output, while in Python 3, the print() function is used.

> 2. Division operator: In Python 2, the division operator (/) behaves differently depending on the type of the operands. If the operands are both integers, it performs floor division, while if either operand is a float, it performs true division. In Python 3, the division operator always performs true division, regardless of the type of the operands.

> 3. Exception handling: In Python 2, the syntax for handling exceptions is different from Python 3. In Python 2, the except clause must specify the exception class, while in Python 3, it can specify the exception class or exception instance.

> 4. Unicode support: Python 3 has improved support for Unicode, with all strings being Unicode by default. In Python 2, Unicode support is optional and must be explicitly enabled.

Of those four bullet points, #1 is basically correct. #2 is *sort of* correct, but worded much too strongly -- in *both* Python 2 and 3, the result of the `/` and `//` operators depends (in general) on the types of the operands, and the only thing that was changed in Python 3 was the behavior for `int`s. #3 is totally wrong. And #4 is half-correct, but saying Unicode support is ""optional"" in Python 2 is very poor phrasing. You don't ""enable"" it; it's always enabled, and you *use* it by constructing `unicode` objects.

This is perfectly natural and will pertain your entire life. You will always encounter something that you struggle with, even in professional programming.

Right now, you are battling two fronts: learning *a programming language* (the easier part) and learning *programming* (the difficult part).

First thing you need to understand that the above two fronts are two distinct, different things. Learning a programming language is only learning the keywords and its grammar as well as some tricks and quirks. Learning *programming* is learning to write a meaningful fully developed novel.

You need to split these two things.

You need to arrive at the point where you understand that creating the program, the *algorithm* is independent from creating the *implementation* in the programming language of your choice. Once you have an algorithm, it should be possible to implement it in more or less any programming language.

The actual code is only the final product, the end of a long train of thoughts, considerations, and compromises. It is a necessary evil because it is the only way that enables us to explain to the computer what we want it to do.

When you attack a problem, don't straight away go to the computer. Don't try to attempt to directly write code. This is not the way.

Read the problem multiple times to the point where you think you have fully understood it. Then, take a break. Do something completely different. Do something mundane. Household chores, take a walk, work out, whatever. Then, after the break read the problem again. Give your brain time to process the information.

Once you have full understanding of the problem, develop a coarse solution - as *you*, the person, would do it. Don't even think about programming it yet. Focus on the steps *you* need to take. Detail these steps. Note down every single, small step. The smaller the steps are, the more detailed they are, the better.

If you can't come up with an immediate or satisfactory solution, stop working on the problem. It is most likely that your brain needs more time to process the information. Sleep over it.

Test your steps against some sample data. Change the steps until they produce the desired outcome.

At this point, you should have a clear understanding of both, the problem and the steps you need to take to create the solution.

With the detailed steps you should be able to nearly 1:1 convert them into a program.

What ChatGPT (and other AIs) can do, is to create all the standard, basic ""pizza""-code that you build your application on. If you are creating a web-application, chances are that you are going to need a backend, store some data in a database, convert data-tables into objects, transfer those to the frontend through some REST-API, create a frontend to receive data, display data in lists, and create forms to edit those data. And that's before adding any business-logic to the application!

This is boring work, really repetitive, but not so repetitive that you can re-use code from earlier projects. Of course you have to learn how to do it, in order to ask ChatGPT to do it for you, and fix all the mistakes it makes - and that part of learning might seem a bit annoying, like learning multiplication-tables when you have a calculator. But once you get to use it actively, and can work on more interesting code, it will be amazing!

Some ""code-monkey""-jobs, where you only ever create this basic code, they are going to disappear, and the bootcamps that only teach to that level, they are going to close, or level up.

And no chatgpt is fancy and all, but this is no <em>actual intelligence</em> like yours. It won’t be able to solve new issues, or adapt to specific use cases. It has no <em>creativity</em>.</p>

But you would if you were trying to _build_ one. 

Or, another way to look at things: you don't necessarily need to know how a power tool works to use it. But if I hand you a box of 20 power tools, and you have _zero_ knowledge of what they are or how they work, then you might as well not have any, since it's just a big box of options for you.

The ""low-code/no-code"" thing is about reducing the number of tools in the box and automating their use. It lets you do things like building a website or creating a dashboard or creating an automated workflow, but it doesn't give you the same kind of freedom as writing code does. By intention. They are all tools that are constrained to solving very narrow problems, so that the user doesn't need a large background of programming to solve that particular class of problems.

And they're good enough for the problems they're solving. But they can't replace programmers entirely (and not just in the sense that someone has to program the tools, there are plenty of areas where they just can't do the job).

>I don't doubt whether there are some people that still need to understand those internals, but... am I that person?

If you're writing custom code, then yes, you are that person. This isn't even something that you have to know to the level of academic study. You need a good working understanding of the basic data structures (because you'll likely have to build some custom ones based on the fundamental ones), and a basic understanding of algorithm analysis. You need to be able to look at an algorithm and determine its worst-case runtime. This enables you to make smarter choices up-front.

Simple example: being presented with two datasets, you need to find matches between them. Without a DS&A background, you might think ""two nested loops"". With a DS&A background, you understand that such an algorithm's runtime grows quadratically based on the sizes of the input, and if the datasets are large enough, will require an alternative, more efficient approach. Without that background, you might not even think to ask the AI about a more efficient approach until you do the work and eventually test it against huge data.

<p>Or, another way to look at things: you don&#39;t necessarily need to know how a power tool works to use it.

ChatGPT is just a tool. It’s not going to replace anybody in itself. You still need a human to use and interpret it’s results. 

If an employer needs a competent engineer - they’re gonna make sure they’re hiring someone who knows their stuff. It doesn’t matter if Google exists or AI. 

Also, nobody can predict how AI will shape the future. True AI won’t exist likely in our lifetime or if it’s even possible to begin with.

It sounds like you’ve never worked in an enterprise application. Adding features can be complicated and many many many times you’ll have to write your own logic, as in your own algorithms to make the feature do what you intend it to. So you’re only hurting your own programming skills. 

What do you think programming is if it isn’t writing algorithms all the time? Algorithms aren’t only to manipulate data.

<p>From what you said, I&#39;d go for ML here, in particular if it goes into things like evaluating problems for suitability for ML, limitations and pitfalls, and how ML is actually used in business applications. Testing is kinda meh and crypto is useful, but moreso if you&#39;re wanting to go into cybersecurity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elective-2 we have 1) Artificial Intelligence and deep learning. 2) Management and Entrepreneurship. 3)Cyber security and cyber laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could double down on AI, but that class looks to be more specific but may also be more of the science and math behind it, so the management class sounds like a good fit for you. Again, security mainly if you&#39;re interested in cybersecurity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elective-1 we have 1) Big Data. 2) Agile software process. 3) Ethical hacking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Big Data is an incredibly useful skill for both development and business for data-oriented industries (tech, finance, etc). If this sounds awful to you or you&#39;re much more interested in the day to day running of a software team, agile process could also be good. You said you weren&#39;t interested in hacking.</p>

I'm a retired University Lecturer. Over 50 years of programming exp, involved in training for 15 years, then University teaching for 20 years, all the time still involved in writing real-world code and consulting.

My guess is that you are looking at coding problems and recommended solutions. Is that right?

In my experience, students very frequently over-complicate the stated problem. Usually, a problem is designed to demonstrate or teach a particular concept, language feature, or technique. The important thing is to learn from the suggested solution when it differs from yours.

In the real world the problems are rarely broken down to such nice conceptual chunks. The real world is much more messy. A new code base can start out with nice clean separation of concerns, independent modules and classes, nicely layered, blah, blah, blah. And then life happens.

Plenty of discussion in answer to your question focusses on whether fewer lines is ""better"" in some way. All things being equal, I say yes. It is usually faster, and easier to understand. Your code is going to be read many more times than it gets changed. By all things being equal, I mean

* You write easily understandable code.
* You avoid deliberately inefficient code such as 13 nested if else's to work out the number of days in a month.
* You understand \*how your language works\*, for example, in C you can rely on the compiler to do code optimisation, not so much in Python. But in Python every variable is a reference so comparisons are fast (over simplifying it heaps), in C you have to know whether to compare the strings or the pointers. Also, does your language short circuit logical tests?
* You know the libraries that come with the language, and how to use them. They do things faster and better than most of us can (easily) produce ourselves.

So, as a programming beginner those are what I recommend you focus on, plus never leave a bug or problem until you understand it c-o-m-p-l-e-t-e-l-y. Oh, and RTFM. The actual language reference manual. People love YT vids, and looking up code on Q&A sites, but here's a fact:

If you ask someone else, you'll always learn less than they know. Sometimes they're not correct, or have a non-optimal way of doing it, or you get the wrong understanding.

Once you have those patterns identified, you can actually bring them forward and ask for help on improving it. But the problem with what you are asking is that there’s too much ambiguity, missing context, and preference involved for a “right” answer.</p>

You’re approaching code the wrong way, if you’re trying to optimize based on source form.

For most languages you’ll use—except shell/batch scripts—there’s a compiler that converts your code into some reduced, easy-to-consume form for later consumption by an interpreter, with your CPU serving as the ur-interpreter at the base of the language stack. Languages like C/C++ usually run ~directly on the CPU, but for C\# you have an additional CIL bytecode stage for the CLR above that. The CIL binary is usually run through an A^(head)O^(f)T^(ime) pass that converts most of it to machine code for direct execution. Java (which is what CLR was intended to embrace/extend/extinguish) is usually interpreted as bytecode except for specific “hot” spots which are J^(ust-)I^(n-)T^(ime)-translated to machine code by the JVM—IIRC CLR can do this too now, although it started out AOT-only.

At each level of transformation, the higher-level representation is squished, stretched, or obliterated in order to fit the lower-level representation, which often uses different input/output formats, execution models, memory models, and optimization tricks from the HLL. (CLR & JVM bytecodes are *close* to the original source code in terms of info content, but their formats and programming models are quite different.) Importantly, each of the conversions your code undergoes can involve optimization for speed, code size, communication, bandwidth, cache misses, branch mispredicts, “safety“ or “security” in some guise, or power usage; this is where things kinda take off. (Your code might also be instrumented in different ways to collect data about those metrics as it runs.)

Source code is similar to equations in math, and optimizers can manipulate the structure and semantics of code just like you’d use algebra or calculus to manipulate equations. By the time it makes it into assembly or machine code, your program will usually be unrecognizable without reverse-engineering.

Frexahmple: Let’s say you’ve written an absolute value function, which I’m going to write in pseudocode—but it’d look roughly the same in any braces language:

	public static ulong abs(long x) {
		if(x < 0L) return -(ulong)x; //¹
		return x;
	}

Very basic, could be written any number of ways.

First let’s play with it in context. An easy place to start is giving it a constant argument:

	ulong v = abs(-4);
	Process.stdout.println(v);

Here, the optimizer will hopefully see that `4` is a literal, `-4` is constant, and therefore we can clone or inline this `abs` call by subbing in `-4L` for arg `x`, giving us

	if(-4L < 0L) return -(-4L);
	return -4L;

Here we/optimizer can easily see that `-4L < 0` is always true, `-(-4L)`⇒`4UL` will always be returned, and `return -4L` is dead code (won’t ever execute). So we’re left with just `ulong v=4UL` at the call site, with no actual call to `abs`. Because `v` is now a constant `4UL`, we can eliminate it too, leaving only

	Process.stdout.println(4UL);

If the optimizer understands the `println` call, it may go even further:

	Process.stdout.print(""4\n"");

So the output form (`4UL` &seq.) is totally different from the source code (`abs(-4)` & `abs` itself). —Hell, it’d be *difficult* to come up with a correct `abs` that’s complicated enough to prevent a constant return if given a constant argument, unless inlining isn’t possible.

Another context, getting slightly more complicated:

	long k = Process.stdin.readLong();
	if(k > 0) break; // matters not whither
	Process.stdout.println(abs(k));

`k` isn’t constant; its value can’t possibly be known until run time. But there’s a constraint on it beyond its type: By the time `abs` is called, `k` is definitely ≤0. If we inline `abs` here, we have [pardon notation]

	long @Constrain(<= 0L) x = ↑k;
	if(x < 0L) return -x;
	return x;

and pushing `x`’s constraints into the the `if`:

	if((long @Constrain(<=0L))x < 0L) return -…x;
	return x;

So from 𝛤 = *after* the `if` we know

> 𝛤⊦`x <= 0L` ∧ ¬(`x < 0L`); ∴

> 𝛤⊦`x <= 0L` ∧ `x >= 0L`; ∴

> 𝛤⊦`x == 0L`

leaving us with

	if(x < 0L) return -x;
	return 0L;

and −0=0 so the returns can be merged to just `return -x`, and we can pull that right up into the call site:

	Process.println((ulong)-k);

So in context, the exact format of `abs`’s body doesn’t really matter.

We can examine `abs` alone—it’s `public`, so the compiler will need an un-inlined copy. Although most CPUs would be *okay* with the `if`/`else` form (e.g., rendered directly as

		if(x < 0L) goto $L1;
		$t = x;
		goto $L2;
	$L1:
		$t = -…x;
	$L2:
		return $t;

or with the cases flipped), the `if` constitutes a *conditional branch,* and CPUs do a ton of tricks/“illusions”^(, Michael) to try to work around/through those. (GPUs positively loathe them.)

If the CPU has a conditional move instruction like x86 (post-P6) [F]CMOVcc, `abs` can be rejiggered to

	if(x < 0) x = -x;
	return x;

which might lower to machine code

	; x ↔ RSI
	mov  	rax, rsi	; 𝝆=x
	neg  	rsi     	; x=-x
	test 	rax, rax	; 𝝆⋚0?
	cmovl	rax, rsi	; <→𝝆=x
	; RAX ↔ 𝝆

Because the NEG instruction sets the same flags TEST does, we can eliminate the TEST:

	mov   	rax, rsi	; 𝝆=x
	neg   	rsi     	; F.SF=(x=-x)<0
	cmovns	rax, rsi	; ¬F.SF→𝝆=x

—CMOVNS tests the sign flag F.SF, which is copied from the result’s msb. There’s an overflow case at −2^(63) = `Long.MIN_VALUE` for which the input and output values’ representations match, but then it doesn’t matter whether we choose `-x₀` or `x₀`, and it works regardless.

Another possibility is to convert `x < 0` to a mask, use that to zero out the case we don’t want, and then mix that with the case we do want:

	ulong mask = (x < 0L ? ULong.MAX_VALUE : 0UL);
	return (-x & mask) | (x & ~mask);

The `mask` calculation can be reduced to `x >> (Long.BITS - 1)`,² which fills all bits in the result with the sign flag. In assembly, this gives us

	; x ↔ RSI, m[ask] ↔ RCX
	mov	rcx, rsi	; m=x
	sar	rcx, 63 	; m>>=63
	mov	rax, rsi	; 𝝆=x
	neg	rsi     	; x=-x
	and	rsi, rcx	; x&=m
	not	rcx     	; m=~m
	and	rax, rcx	; 𝝆&=m
	or 	rax, rsi	; 𝝆|=x
	; RAX ↔ 𝝆

which is okay—the dependency graph can probably be cleaned up a bit to eliminate some of the hazards—but still a bit excessive, because we’re not looking too closely at the `-x` part of things.

In two’s-complement representations, which is what ~everything uses nowadays for signed ints, `-z == 1 + ~z`. Because `a^b` flips bits in `a` for which the corresponding bit in `b` is set, and because `-1 == ~0` and is therefore all-one-bits, we can render `~z` as `z ^ -1`, and because `+1` ≡ `-(-1)`, we have `-z == (z ^ -1) - -1`. We can also restate `+z` as `(z ^ 0) - 0`, giving us two parallel cases:

	return x < 0L ? (x^-1)-1 : (x^0)-0;

And, since we can get exactly the right −1-or-0 value from `mask`, we end up with

	long mask = x >> 63;
	return (x ^ mask) - mask;

which renders as

	mov rax, rsi
	sar rsi, 63
	xor rax, rsi
	sub rax, rsi

in assembly. This is one solid hazard (WAR into RWAW×2), but it mixes easily with nearby code to hide latency, and it uses only ALU and shifter units which tend to be plentiful in higher-end out-of-order cores. x86 also supports a couple specialized instructions for sign extraction, so if we start with RAX=`x` we can just do

	; RAX ↔ x, RDX ↔ m
	cqdq        	; m=(int128)x>>64
	xor rax, rdx	; 𝝆=x^m
	sub rax, rdx	; 𝝆-=m
	; 𝝆 ↔ RAX

Finally, if your CPU supports SIMD and `abs` is being batch-applied, it can be vectorized. E.g., let’s focus on

	static void absMany(ulong[] out, const long[] arr) {
		for(uoffs i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
			out[i] = abs(arr[i]);
	}

Instead of calling/applying `abs` once per element separately, the optimizer can knock out 8 `abs`es at a time using 512-bit vectors (as for x86 AVX512). First, inline `abs`:

	for(uoffs i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		long x = arr[i], m = x >> (Long.BITS-1);
		out[i] = (x ^ m) - m;
	}

Then unroll the first loop by 8 and use vector shift/subtract:

	uoffs i = 0, rem = arr.length;
	while(rem >= 8) {
		vec[8] long x = arr[i…i+7], m = x ≫̇ 63;
		out[i…i+7] = (x ^ m) ∸ m;
		i += 8; rem -= 8;
	}
	while(rem-- > 0) {
		long x = arr[i], m = x >> 63;
		out[i++] = (x ^ m) - m;
	}

(Sometimes this can even be done for narrower integers using only scalar integer instructions.) Alternatively, the optimizer might just stop at unrolling the loop—this can eliminate the hazards in the compacted `abs`, without vectorizing, and on out-of-order hardware it’s still possible the `abs`es will run in parallel, but they may interfere more with other integer instructions than the vector stuff would.

Again, we’re left with something very unlike the original `abs`, and it’s certainly not a transform most programmers would make themselves, because it’s at a level higher than the `abs` function itself. This is something you’d almost always let an optimizer do for you, because the alternative is banging out all possible input/output structures in separate functions. But optimization is only possible if the optimizer can *actually see* what you’re trying to do, and if it has the rules to fix it up. If you feed it some overcomplicated, opaquely micro-“optimized” form of `abs` in source code form, that’s likely what you’ll get in your output, whether or not it’s actually a good approach.

¹ I’m casting to `ulong` explicitly here in case this is pseudocode for something like C or C++, wherein `-LONG_MIN` is likely undefined behavior. I’m going to omit it in further pseudocode because it doesn’t matter in this arena.

mov     rax, rsi    ; 𝝆=x
neg     rsi         ; x=-x
test    rax, rax    ; 𝝆⋚0?
cmovl   rax, rsi    ; &lt;→𝝆=x
; RAX ↔ 𝝆
</code></pre>

<p>Because the NEG instruction sets the same flags TEST does, we can eliminate the TEST:</p>

<pre><code>mov     rax, rsi    ; 𝝆=x
neg     rsi         ; F.SF=(x=-x)&lt;0
cmovns  rax, rsi    ; ¬F.SF→𝝆=x
</code></pre>

<p>—CMOVNS tests the sign flag F.SF, which is copied from the result’s msb. There’s an overflow case at −2<sup>63</sup> = <code>Long.MIN_VALUE</code> for which the input and output values’ representations match, but then it doesn’t matter whether we choose <code>-x₀</code> or <code>x₀</code>, and it works regardless.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to convert <code>x &lt; 0</code> to a mask, use that to zero out the case we don’t want, and then mix that with the case we do want:</p>

<pre><code>ulong mask = (x &lt; 0L ? ULong.MAX_VALUE : 0UL);
return (-x &amp; mask) | (x &amp; ~mask);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mask</code> calculation can be reduced to <code>x &gt;&gt; (Long.BITS - 1)</code>,² which fills all bits in the result with the sign flag. In assembly, this gives us</p>

<pre><code>; x ↔ RSI, m[ask] ↔ RCX
mov rcx, rsi    ; m=x
sar rcx, 63     ; m&gt;&gt;=63
mov rax, rsi    ; 𝝆=x
neg rsi         ; x=-x
and rsi, rcx    ; x&amp;=m
not rcx         ; m=~m
and rax, rcx    ; 𝝆&amp;=m
or  rax, rsi    ; 𝝆|=x
; RAX ↔ 𝝆
</code></pre>

<p>which is okay—the dependency graph can probably be cleaned up a bit to eliminate some of the hazards—but still a bit excessive, because we’re not looking too closely at the <code>-x</code> part of things.</p>

<p>In two’s-complement representations, which is what ~everything uses nowadays for signed ints, <code>-z == 1 + ~z</code>. Because <code>a^b</code> flips bits in <code>a</code> for which the corresponding bit in <code>b</code> is set, and because <code>-1 == ~0</code> and is therefore all-one-bits, we can render <code>~z</code> as <code>z ^ -1</code>, and because <code>+1</code> ≡ <code>-(-1)</code>, we have <code>-z == (z ^ -1) - -1</code>. We can also restate <code>+z</code> as <code>(z ^ 0) - 0</code>, giving us two parallel cases:</p>

<pre><code>return x &lt; 0L ? (x^-1)-1 : (x^0)-0;
</code></pre>

<p>And, since we can get exactly the right −1-or-0 value from <code>mask</code>, we end up with</p>

<pre><code>long mask = x &gt;&gt; 63;
return (x ^ mask) - mask;
</code></pre>

<p>which renders as</p>

<pre><code>mov rax, rsi
sar rsi, 63
xor rax, rsi
sub rax, rsi
</code></pre>

<p>in assembly. This is one solid hazard (WAR into RWAW×2), but it mixes easily with nearby code to hide latency, and it uses only ALU and shifter units which tend to be plentiful in higher-end out-of-order cores. x86 also supports a couple specialized instructions for sign extraction, so if we start with RAX=<code>x</code> we can just do</p>

<pre><code>; RAX ↔ x, RDX ↔ m
cqdq            ; m=(int128)x&gt;&gt;64
xor rax, rdx    ; 𝝆=x^m
sub rax, rdx    ; 𝝆-=m
; 𝝆 ↔ RAX
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, if your CPU supports SIMD and <code>abs</code> is being batch-applied, it can be vectorized. E.g., let’s focus on</p>

<pre><code>static void absMany(ulong[] out, const long[] arr) {
    for(uoffs i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++)
        out[i] = abs(arr[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of calling/applying <code>abs</code> once per element separately, the optimizer can knock out 8 <code>abs</code>es at a time using 512-bit vectors (as for x86 AVX512). First, inline <code>abs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for(uoffs i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
    long x = arr[i], m = x &gt;&gt; (Long.BITS-1);
    out[i] = (x ^ m) - m;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then unroll the first loop by 8 and use vector shift/subtract:</p>

<pre><code>uoffs i = 0, rem = arr.length;
while(rem &gt;= 8) {
    vec[8] long x = arr[i…i+7], m = x ≫̇ 63;
    out[i…i+7] = (x ^ m) ∸ m;
    i += 8; rem -= 8;
}
while(rem-- &gt; 0) {
    long x = arr[i], m = x &gt;&gt; 63;
    out[i++] = (x ^ m) - m;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Sometimes this can even be done for narrower integers using only scalar integer instructions.) Alternatively, the optimizer might just stop at unrolling the loop—this can eliminate the hazards in the compacted <code>abs</code>, without vectorizing, and on out-of-order hardware it’s still possible the <code>abs</code>es will run in parallel, but they may interfere more with other integer instructions than the vector stuff would.</p>

<p>Again, we’re left with something very unlike the original <code>abs</code>, and it’s certainly not a transform most programmers would make themselves, because it’s at a level higher than the <code>abs</code> function itself. This is something you’d almost always let an optimizer do for you, because the alternative is banging out all possible input/output structures in separate functions. But optimization is only possible if the optimizer can <em>actually see</em> what you’re trying to do, and if it has the rules to fix it up. If you feed it some overcomplicated, opaquely micro-“optimized” form of <code>abs</code> in source code form, that’s likely what you’ll get in your output, whether or not it’s actually a good approach.</p>

<hr/>

<p>¹ I’m casting to <code>ulong</code> explicitly here in case this is pseudocode for something like C or C++, wherein <code>-LONG_MIN</code> is likely undefined behavior. I’m going to omit it in further pseudocode because it doesn’t matter in this arena.</p>

<p>² [Not an exponent.] I’m just going to use <code>63</code> for <code>Long.BITS - 1</code> from here on. For languages that don’t have separate <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> operators, by <code>&gt;&gt;</code> I mean arithmetic = sign-preserving shift specifically.</p>

Language dependent - a very simple example might be as you get deeper into languages you'll know of multiple ways that you can write a loop and they each might have different implications on memory consumption or compute time. Sometimes the nice syntax isn't as efficient as the others. Performance also comes in lots of flavours: memory, compute time, the time it takes to boot an app, the time it takes to compile a project, etc.

None language dependent - you are perhaps working through a collection of objects and processing them - it might be easier to apply a one-size-fits-all algorithm to them, but you know that some of them have caveats that if you coded around, you could process faster. But that would maybe require deeper branching code paths and perhaps make an already complicated algorithm, more complicated. Obviously there are patterns to help with this sort of thing - but the more complexity you add, you'll likely make it harder for someone else to understand and risk over-engineering it. And coming back to the time to code - if you are well within the tolerance for how performant your code should be, then why should you spend more time trying to make it faster?

I think, at least in my mind, I think about readability as not just how clean the code is to read, but how long it would take a developer to read through and understand a functional area of code. Following that on a bit... I remember a time that we rewrote how an App was bootstrapped into entirely different technologies that were strung together in a convoluted manner. The code itself was probably fine - but it was horrible to try and piece together because you were moving through half a dozen technologies to follow the full lifecycle - whereas for every other App, it was just the one. But in that case, it was the absolute fastest way to get this App loaded and performance was absolutely top priority. We knew in the future it would hurt when people have to maintain and read unfamiliar technologies linked in a unique way - but that was the trade off.

To be clear, I should say - you don't always have to sacrifice one for the other. Plenty of problems will have the most performant solution also being sufficiently readable.

Improving throughput frequently involves giving up generality and taking advantage of special features of the problem. Notice how incomprehensible that statement is? That's what ""optimised"" code can read like.

Another way is to reduce redundant operations. They seem to be needed in the verbose version of the code, so how can we reduce them? One way is lookup tables, another is memoization. It's often implemented with lookup tables or hash tables.

Speaking of hash tables, sometimes you can hash large values/objects to make them quicker to compare.

Sometimes you can parallelize your algorithm.

Sometimes you use more memory, which takes more code to manage.

Sometimes you can do a quick but not perfect job that gives the right answer some of the time, and tells you whether you need to do the whole job or not.

 - class properties and methods have limited scope. Keep as few things public as possible.

This code checks for the existence of s3. If s3 doesn’t exist it will return the logical and of s1 and s2’s existence. From then it will recursively check the equality between s1 and s3 and s2 and s3. I went ahead and somewhat tested this to make sure my post had some reason. It checks for s3’s existence because it will recurse into itself and make s3 smaller as well as s2 and s1. Basically, this code will check to make sure that s3 is the “largest” of the strings you input and that the strings are identical. It checks that s1 is the shortest string and that s2 is shorter than s3. It also checks that the strings are identical up until where they end. An example: 

s1 = “te”
s2 = “tes” 
s3 = “test”

This is acceptable output. The following is not accepted by the script: 

s1 = “test” 
s2 = “tes” 
s3 = “te”

Now I see why it’s called combined order in that it checks for the order of the strings as well as string equality. 

Every time s1[1:] is called s1 has its first element removed. In this way the script recursively calls itself until s1 is expended and returns true (if the strings were equal up to that point) or false, or until s3 is expended and the whole script ends up returning false.

Tips for commit messages from personal experience and as a summary of interesting Linux kernel guide to submitting patches (linked below):

1. Keep the first line, the \`summary phrase\` short aim for 50 characters but it's OK if you have to go over
2. Add a blank line this will make it so that only the summary phrase is printed in abbreviated git logs and allows GitHub to pick it up as the subject for a Pull Request
3. Now you can go hog wild with the body of the explanation but do keep it under 75 lines. You may not want to have a body for any small changes/fixes especially if you are going to squash them, but for the final commit, you'll want to definitely have a well-crafted body. Aim to describe the problem, user-visible impact, any optimizations, and trade-offs, describe what your commit/diff/PR does, and feel free to use examples and ASCII art.
4. Solve only one problem per patch/PR, that requires judgment but if the description starts to get long you should probably split up the patch/PR.
5. ""Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. ""make xyzzy do frotz instead of ""\[This patch\] makes xyzzy do frotz"" or ""\[I\] changed xyzzy to do frotz"", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behaviour."" <-- straight from the doc linked below. This one made my commit logs and PRs more consistent, and easier to read and write as the mood is now a constant and one less item to think about. 
6. Reference external issues or tickets that are relevant to the change for posterity and to help the reviewer have as much context as possible.

Looking for complete tutorials will deprive you of the actual *problem solving* as it is already done for you. Yet, exactly this part is the key to becoming a programmer, and even more to become a *self sustainable* programmer.

The code is only the end result, a necessary evil that we have to face since it is the only thing the stupid computer understands.

The really important part is the *algorithm*, the *step by step instructions* for the solution.

A programmer needs to learn to create these step by step instructions. The code then becomes only a final result, a (ideally) 1:1 translation of the steps.

If the tutorials you use are high enough quality, they will discuss the thought process that leads to the algorithm that then leads to the code.

Yet, I would definitely stop before the code. I would stop at the algorithm.

And still, your learning outcome will not be the same as if you were banging your head against the problem to come up with your own solution - even if your solution is inferior.

Maybe try a completely different approach (that I generally recommend everywhere): *plan before program*.

+ Read your assignment multiple times
+ Take a break and do something completely different
+ Come back and read the assignment again
+ Ensure that you *fully understand* the assignment
+ Start developing a *manual solution* - as *you*, the person, would solve your problem - **Don't think about the computer, or a programming language** - this is important
+ Note the steps that you are taking down. Use flow charts, pseudo code, bullet lists, whatever 
+ Be extremely detailed in your steps - every single thing you do
+ You can also start with a coarse plan and then refine the plan
+ Ideally, steps are atomic, i.e. doing exactly one thing
+ Test your steps against sample inputs. Verify that they are correct.
+ Refine if necessary
+ Only once you are satisfied with the steps and only once they pass your tests start thinking about programming
+ At this point, ideally your steps translate 1:1 into code

<p>The best place to learn if you are crossing any lines is with your professor / TA. Ask what resources are OK. Ask how to properly cite referenced resources when turning in assignments. Sometimes there are assignments where the entire goal is bending your brain into rediscovering an insight. Watching a YouTube video might remove that experience. Practically, in your first year, there&#39;s not a lot of risk. But, the longer you go, the more likely a video or tutorial will lead to tell tale signs in your implementation.

Outcome: A proof of concept which can be improved on for future uses.

As for a physical device I do not know but I will guess not. The reason is that even though you can still use the web based ide, there is a device driver (available for windows, Mac and linux) that is required to transfer the code to the Arduino.

So if that driver comes with Android, you may well be good to go. I don't think there is anything special about the driver that makes it arduino specific, so I might be available for android - I just haven't heard of it. If you have access to an arduino, you could just give it a try.


Fwiw, the driver creates the com ports that the arduino ecosystem uses to talk to the connected ports.

Bare in mind that if you use an arduino clone that uses a ch340 chip, a different driver will be required to recognise the board.

I don&#39;t think there is anything special about the driver that makes it arduino specific, so I might be available for android - I just haven&#39;t heard of it. If you have access to an arduino, you could just give it a try.</p>

<p>Fwiw, the driver creates the com ports that the arduino ecosystem uses to talk to the connected ports.</p>

<p>Bare in mind that if you use an arduino clone that uses a ch340 chip, a different driver will be required to recognise the board.</p>

<p>Hopefully the above will give you some leads to either just give it a try and troubleshoot or research a bit deeper. All the best and please be sure to let us know how you get on - others may also be interested in knowing the answer to this question.</p>

Keep practicing. To be even competent as a full stack dev polyglot, will take you years. 

Given your background, the best advice I can give you is to carve up the time you spend practicing into  2 buckets. 

1) Teach yourself data structures and algorithms. There are a ton of online resources for you to accomplish this. It will teach you how to recognize patterns that exist throughout you entire development journey, at every level.

Browser like examples are everywhere, OSs, IDEs, Games, Social Networks and so on.</p>

<p>Edited. I forgot to note important thing about where in my opinion &quot;Reinventing the wheel&quot; comes from. Most developers misunderstand what does it mean, it means that when you have a project at hand you should not write everything from scratch but you should use a standard library. That is it&#39;s explicit meaning, I as a c# developer would be a moron to reject use of it&#39;s extensive BCL and start writing let&#39;s say LINQ ( which is a huge and good thing ) myself.</p>

Time is precious. Imagine the following situation, you ask, they give the correct code, then you ask more, then they have to answer. You see it's more time-consuming than writing a long answer that explain almost-everything in detail. It's called being informative!

For example, how to copy a list in a python? Sure I can give you a straight answer `new_list = old_list.copy()` But you will never know there are alternatives.

<p>also textbooks, no matter what at least explain as close to plain english as possible for the learning process of a student, not just listing of facts. It tries to connect real-world to the abstract.</p>

<p>In any case, thanks for the debate, but I&#39;m kind of over it now. Let&#39;s just agree to disagree at this point. Clearly you have some reason to defend SO because maybe it helped you in the past, but I&#39;m telling you that in recent years, SO has not been so kind to beginners, and there is actual documentations all over reddit, youtube, and websites, that argues that exact sentiment and how they&#39;ve experienced SO.</p>

Those who are saying it's impossible I'm not sure what they're thinking. It's impossible as far as serving these pages dynamically, where the ""content"" of the page is combined with the ""template"" at request time, but that's very not necessary for what you're hoping to do.

I recently built my own static site generator for a personal website which you can find here: [https://github.com/plungepool/wiki-dot-plungepool-dot-dev](https://github.com/plungepool/wiki-dot-plungepool-dot-dev)

The generator consists of a folder of HTML templates, a CSS file, a folder of content files in markdown, and a python script. I've set up github actions to run the python script whenever there is a new commit. You could also do this with C. My python script goes through each markdown file, converts it to HTML, and performs a find and replace on the appropriate HTML template to generate the page. Then that folder of HTML files is what gets served as the website. I set up a cron task on my server that pulls the new version of this repo every 5 minutes so the site gets automatically updated with any changes I've made.

For those wondering ""why would you bother to do such a thing without Javascript"" there are several reasons. One is that static sites are super fast and light on bandwidth. If I wanted to I could set up a raspberry pi in my home as a server to host the site without issue. Static sites save processing power by rendering the entire website only once with each new update and are eco-friendly. Some people also just enjoy the relative simplicity of maintaining a site like this, especially in contrast to ""easier"" CMS platforms like Wordpress which can become cumbersome and require constant security updates, browser compatibility can also become complex.

If you decide to build your own static site generator in C, I think you would learn a lot. It's a great beginner project IMO. If you decided to learn javascript you'd learn a lot too.

To answer your question directly: JavaScript allows for [pagination](https://www.educba.com/pagination-in-javascript/).

(4) The database sends this data back to the server, (5) where if necessary, the server makes changes before (pagination likely takes place here; for example, if the blog post has five pictures and only the first needs to be shown before clicking on ""Load more"", pagination sends back one picture, and sends the four remaining pictures only after ""Load more"" is clicked) (6) sending it back to the website to show that data.!<

This is not true. So long as the iFrame has an appropriate ""title"" attribute its probably ok. Accessibility is the only reason I can think of that this would be a problem but even that is probably going to be alright. Maybe if some components contained a lot of links it would cause problems but saying iFrames in general are not accessible is not true.

> iFrames open you up to a number of security risks, some can be mitigated with a good CSP

How are you going to exploit a website that doesn't even use JS?

> iFrames semi-sandbox content, it's pretty easy to escape this sand box, but it does make interactions between content inside of an iFrame and outside of one tricky. Applying CSS, opening links etc. Things that should be simple take on an added layer of complexity.

Thats fair. But I think this more falls into the category of ""there are better ways"" rather than a reason why this couldn't work.

> iFrames will cause a performance hit, it likely won't be noticeable for a simple static site

Generally true but I doubt it would be a problem here. If its just HTML its going to load lightening fast. Maybe faster than a JS solution. Even if its not the performance hit would be so negligible that its not worth consideration.

> iFrames aren't great for SEO, not a concern for OP.

I am skeptical of this. iFrames have been around for nearly 30 years. Web-crawlers probably know how to make sense of them. If OP really cared about SEO they would probably have to make some special considerations to make sure things are optimized but such is true for any stack.

> iFrames don't fully address the initial issue, sure it allows OP to re-use an html file over and over, but only if they don't need to make adjustments to that file based on it's location.

I don't think I follow this one. I am guessing its going to be a simple HTML site so everything is going to be updated by hand with a text editor.

--------------------------------

To take the notes: 

I just used nice plain/simple Microsoft notepad, and a .txt file. (Don't forget to turn on wordwrap mode!) 

I labelled each topic-section with leading underscores, that way to search for a topic, I just put an underscore, then a space, and topic name and it would then jump to that section. 

I also used a series of underscores to create visual dividing lines, so it adds visual breaks and a less cluttered look.

Yeah I think the main benefit of an overview is so that you “know what you don’t know” and are at least aware of the options out there even if you don’t remember them exactly.

This would probably be a separate section, but it seems popular enough to be worthwhile. Despite having used React professionally pretty much continually since its release I’ve actually barely used Redux though so I might not be the best one for that one.

Yeah I can cover it though in the spirit of xinyminutes it might not be as in-depth of an explanation as might be needed to grok the philosophy.

I'm a big fan of flowcharting, and it's saved me a lot of trouble over the past several years, because I know what I need beforehand. Some people sit down and they just attack the IDE immediately, and then they go, ""Where do I go from here?""

I look at it like building a car. You've got a lot of parts that go together into a lot of subsystems, and those subsystems have to get integrated into (potentially other subsystems, or) the finished product. When you don't plan beforehand, you end up with a bunch of parts on the floor and a car that looks like The Homer and is held together with duct tape and chicken wire. But, if you start designing by saying, ""All right, it needs an engine. What does the engine need? Okay, now it needs a way to deliver power to the drive wheels. All right, how does that integrate with the engine? Fuel delivery system..."" and so on and so forth. 

So, with a program, you can do a flowchart in broad strokes, like everything that needs to be updated before the next frame draw, or how the computer is supposed to respond in any situation of Tic-Tac-Toe. You divide the overall problem into parts, sketch out those parts, write the code for those parts, and then move on to the next subsystem. Absent planning out some sort of structure beforehand, you're going to work on part of the user-interface one second and then work on scorekeeping the next second and then something else, and so on. You just spend the whole time pantsing it, and you're scattered like an teenage boy with ADHD who's trying to learn in class while the student in front of you is watching porn and there are flashing stage lights everywhere. Your code is going to look like it was just thrown together, and you're going to spend a bunch of time organizing it, or it's just not going to be maintainable. 

So. Stop saying, ""Step one: Open up the IDE and start typing the first thing that comes to mind."" Think about the problem. Ask any of the pros around here if they spend more time typing or more time thinking out a problem or reading documentation. Do they just start hammering away and maybe refine it later, or do they give it some thought first? 

Now, take all of this with a grain of salt, because I switched my major over to Engineering when I decided I really don't like pushing pixels as much as I like controlling robots and manufacturing systems and things that interact with the real world. But, I still tutor some of the students here, and the thing that most of them have in common is they don't think before they start. It's not that they don't understand the language's vocabulary and syntax; their structure just sucks. Duct tape and chicken wire. 

But, as far as programming goes, and this especially applies to the PLCs that I'm programming for one of my current classes, the most valuable programming course I ever took was a flowcharting course where we never wrote a single line of executable code.

    • Read your code and try to spot any visible errors there might be.
    • Google your problem, not ""source code for tic-tac-toe"" but, ""2d array not working in python"" or whatever language your using. Usually people have had the same problem before and others have helped them fix it.
    • Ask people for help, theres plenty of communities where you could ask more experienced developers for help, eg: discord servers, stackoverflow, reddit, etc... (make sure you don't directly go to this step, as it can become a bad hobby and asking people for help with ""stupid"" errors could get u banned at specific communities).

Usually by the end of this you'd figure out whats the problem, but sometimes its very unexpected that get fixed very weirdly, for example by restarting your IDE or ur whole computer even.

An example of my Tic Tac Toe thoughts:

Board needs to hold elements and be addressable, some sort of array is probably best

Pieces need to be rendered as X and O, probably store them as strings

How does the game start? With an empty rendered board probably so you need a function that displays the array, something like:

    def renderArr(arr):
        for item in arr:
            print item
            if item.index % 3:
                newline

Next you need a function for assigning Xs and Os by address, assuming a console input it could be something as simple as:

    def putX(xCoord, yCoord, arr):
        if arr[xCoord+yCoord] = None:
            arr[xCoord+yCoord] = x
    (same thing for putO)

Next you need a function that detects a win, some gameplay loop that initialized the board, handles turns, and ends when the game is over.

Finally put all that into some sort of main file with logic to start the game, choose starting piece, and maybe even an option for PvE or PvP that is checked for in the gameplay loop.

    Arr board
    Str X

I rolled my own version over HTTP, and I'd agree that HTTP expertise is a must for it. Though, there's something to be said for learning all the nitty gritty ways to tailor your keep-alive packets to avoid various networks, OS, and applications from dropping the TCP connection on you, while avoiding excessive bandwidth use.

Keep-Alive Packet Hints:

- Packets are usually 4 KiB (4096 bytes) including the HTTP headers
- HTTP headers are only sent at the start of the stream, so keep-alive packets are smaller, though they still need to be carried by full (usually 4 KiB) packets over the wire
- OS and Network hardware only care about packets, and reset timeouts with each packet, even if the payload is only 1 byte.
- Applications often need a minimum of some non-whitespace followed by a newline (`\n`), so `.\n` is a very good payload for a keep-alive
- Make sure you use `flush` on any output to the keep-alive stream, to ensure it doesn't just hang out in the server- or client-side buffer
  - The simple version is just `stdout.write('.\n'); stdout.flush()` from the server and `stdin.read()` on the client. I use `.\n` to signal ""keep waiting"" and `x\n` to signal any other message, where `x` depends on the type of message.
- Very few networks/OS/applications have a timeout of less than 60 seconds; a conservative 40 to 50 second interval between keep-alive packets works well
- It's common for a single user or set of users to all start connections within the same second (opening multiple tabs, network being restored after outage, etc.); so it reduces peak load issues to even the traffic out over time by varying the interval randomly, e.g. between 40 seconds and 50 seconds.",1674353646.0,t1_j5cx29z,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>

If it is a lossless one (or more accurately one that features persistence), for example, MQ (i.e. Message Queue), then the ""Q bit"" addresses this by saving the notifications until the subscriber reconnects.

To use the phone analogy, this could loosely be likened to voicemail. When you switch your phone back on, you will get a notification that you have a voicemail, which you can then retrieve from the queue of voicemails.

From the notifications viewpoint, this retrieval process occurs automatically by the phone reconnecting to the message queue and as a side affect of re-establishing that connection, it will see and thus retrieve the messages that have been queued up. This is sort of similar when you ""reconnect"" to the voicemail service and it will start playing your messages back one by one.

---

There are also lossy (or more accurately non persistent) architectures, I can't immediately think of one that might be relevant except perhaps a weather app.

If you think about how the weather app might work, it is unlikely that every phone, tablet and PC will enquire every so often for the current weather. While not impossible, this would create a fairly large load on the weather providers servers (and would be unnecessary). Certainly alerts such as ""thunderstorm"" or ""flood"" warnings won't work that way because if it did, you might be on the ""wrong timing"" and miss those alerts or not get them in a timely fashion.

But, thinking about weather alerts, if your device is switched off (out of battery or whatever) and you miss them, once they have passed (i.e. no longer current) you don't really want to get them all when you next connect.

So these use a more publish/subscribe mechanism to communicate them (there is a second part which I will mention next). publish/subscribe is like a TV or radio broadcast. The publisher will ""broadcast"" a message such as the weather alert. The subscriber - i.e. all the weather apps, will subscribe to, or in the radio/TV example tune into the frequency/channel) allowing it to receive those alerts. (Edit:) So, now we have a model where the publisher simply says ""Yo, all'ya'all - listen up, here is a weather alert"" and everybody who is listening gets it at basically the same time.

The second part to this is how to deal with a current alert that was broadcast but you missed it. The weather app will (or should) tell you that there is a current alert. So this is the second part that may (or not if it isn't relevant) be used in this model.

So the complete workflow will be that when a, for example, weather alert is raised, it will be published as described above. It will also be stored in a register of ""current events"". So when the phone is restarted, the weather app will (or should) query the ""current events"" register and thus this is how it will know about alerts that are current but were missed from the initial ""broadcast"". Obviously when the alert expires, then the alert would be removed from the ""current alerts"" register and thus if the weather App restarts after that time, you won't be notified about an expired alert (because it doesn't appear in the register any more).

I hope that all makes sense.

Good questions BTW.

The behavior of your code is either too complicated, or it isn't sufficiently modularized and it takes too much ceremony to call into your code.

My suggestions:

1. Use your type system to make certain categories of bugs flat out impossible. This lets you focus on writing unit tests for more interesting logic-related things. [Parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) is an article with some useful suggestions on how to do this in practice.
2. Bias towards writing non-side-effectful functions. Minimizing mutations also helps keep things simple. Push out all IO and side effects to the ""edges"" of your code. Also see [functional core, imperative shell].
3. If your code must perform mutation, try splitting your logic into two steps: one that's a side-effect-free function that decides what mutation to perform, and the second to actually perform it. Focus your unit tests on the first piece, not the second. If the first step is particularly convoluted, I like structuring it as a stage machine. Then, my tests boil down to checking all of the state transitions.
4. Deliberately go out of your way to remove edge cases from your code. For example, suppose your code does one thing when passed in an empty list and another when it's given a non-empty one. Can you find some way of sensibly merging these cases together?
5. Don't fall back to using dependency injection as a first step. Instead, bias towards injecting in the data you actually want. Have the caller be responsible for fetching that data instead.(https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell)
6. Don't push yourself to unit test literally everything. Focus on unit testing the core logic (which can be written in a functional and side-effect-free style) and integration tests for everything else. 
7. Try writing [table-driven tests](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/07/prefer-table-driven-tests).

<p>try a different way and then ask for help if I really get stuck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s essentially my answer, but I mention my thought process and reading for each step as well.</p>

<p>Check documentation: &quot;I do this because often a lot of work has gone into preparing it and many many times I&#39;ve found the solution there.&quot;</p>

<p>Try a different way: &quot;I like to solve problems and trying new ways can lead to a solution, but if not I&#39;ve gain more knowledge what does and doesn&#39;t work for future issues. I support my new attempt with resources from Google, stackexchange etc&quot;</p>

<p>Ask for help: &quot;I&#39;m not afraid to admit when I don&#39;t know something and I love learning. If a coworker has had a similar issue, they can teach me. Plus at this stage I don&#39;t want to waste company time fooling around with failed attempts.&quot;</p>

It’s very visual and lets you literally build your program by putting together little blocks.

On top of that it’s all in the browser so it takes 0 setup (setting up your first development environment without help can be a huge rabbit hole depending on what language & computer you are on).

The concepts you learn will transfer super well to “real” languages, and make them much less overwhelming, maybe your boyfriend would enjoy helping you learn a less beginner friendly language like java after?

Even if you decide to stick with java, I still suggest you try something more basic like scratch for the first week as it’s the easiest way to get started and avoid getting overloaded.

tldr:  answer: O( n^5 )

our loops are:

    i for 0..n-1
	   j for 0..i*i - 1
		  k for 0..j-1
		  
For simplicity I shifted the ""1"" and used:

    i from 1..n
	   j from 1..i*i
		  k for 1..j
                1
		  
		  
There's a slight discrepance going from (i-1)(i-1) = i^2 - 2i +1 to i^2, but that doesn't affect the O()

So, the loop count:

    i from 1..n
	   j from 1..i*i 
		  j    # sum(1) from k=1 to k=j  

From Wolfram Alpha power series:

sum(x) x=1..n is (1/2)(n^2 + n) giving us:

    i from 1..n
	   (1/2)(i^2^2 + i^2)
		
equals

    i from 1..n
	   (1/2)( i^4 ) + (1/2)( i^2 )

equals

    i from 1..n
	   (1/2)( i^4 )
    plus
	 i from 1..n
	   (1/2)( i^2 )
		
From Wolfram Alpha power series for a final answer of:


    (1/2)(1/30)(6n^5 + 15n^4 +10n^3 -n)
	+(1/2)(1/6)(2n^3 + 3n^2 + n)
	
	
As a sanity check, let n=100.  answer = 1_025_335_840

<p>There&#39;s a slight discrepance going from (i-1)(i-1) = i<sup>2</sup> - 2i +1 to i<sup>2,</sup> but that doesn&#39;t affect the O()</p>

<p>So, the loop count:</p>

<pre><code>i from 1..n
   j from 1..i*i 
      j    # sum(1) from k=1 to k=j  
</code></pre>

<p>From Wolfram Alpha power series:</p>

<p>sum(x) x=1..n is (1/2)(n<sup>2</sup> + n) giving us:</p>

<pre><code>i from 1..n
   (1/2)(i^2^2 + i^2)
</code></pre>

<p>equals</p>

<pre><code>i from 1..n
   (1/2)( i^4 ) + (1/2)( i^2 )
</code></pre>

<p>equals</p>

<pre><code>i from 1..n
   (1/2)( i^4 )
plus
 i from 1..n
   (1/2)( i^2 )
</code></pre>

<p>From Wolfram Alpha power series for a final answer of:</p>

<pre><code>(1/2)(1/30)(6n^5 + 15n^4 +10n^3 -n)
+(1/2)(1/6)(2n^3 + 3n^2 + n)
</code></pre>

<p>As a sanity check, let n=100.  answer = 1_025_335_840 </p>

<p>This matches the answer that I got by running the code 7 hours ago.

Basically you only need to use classes [] and `alternation` which is the vertical line '|' to cover 90% of use cases. Go to regex101 and use the quick reference in the bottom right of webpage.

# Parser Combinators

## Academic Background 

The idea of building parsers with functions goes back to the 70s and 80s, but the academic paper that this approach is really inspired by is Hutton and Meijer's 1996 paper [*Monadic Parser Combinators*](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf), where they demonstrate the idea that parsers form a monad.

A lot of this (actually, all of it) is academic wankery - you don't have to read it if you don't want to. But the paper might be handy to refer to when you ask ""Why the hell is this even a thing, anyway?""

## Haskell

The `parsec` Python library is based on the [equivalent Haskell library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec). The most important thing about this is that Haskell has a few infix operators that mean very different things from what they mean in Python. Python's `parsec` library follows the Haskell convention, so some operators will be confusing. I'll point this out when it comes up.

## What is a parser?

A parser is a function that takes a sequence of tokens, possibly consumes some of those tokens, and either succeeds or fails. In Haskell, there's a type for this - the `Either` type, which either contains a success value or an error value. Python's `parsec` implementation implements a `Value` class that is similar.

In academic literature, the idea of a ""token"" is extremely general - it can be of any type. For the purposes of this post, we're going to be very explicit. A token is a **single character**.

For efficiency reasons, Python's implementation is colored by the fact that it's likely working on strings, which are expensive to copy. Instead of returning a substring of the original string to denote consumption, it works on *indices*. You pass it an index to denote where in the string the parser is currently running, and it gives you back another index to denote how much of the string it has consumed. You'll see this below.

## Start With The Basics

At the very bottom of the library are *primitive parsers*, which succeed for very simple things. Let's write some code.

    import parsec
    letter_parser = parsec.letter()

This is our very first parser! Let's call it in a couple different contexts.

    >>> letter_parser # What is this variable, exactly?
    <parsec.Parser object at 0x7f19b8a903d0>
    >>> letter_parser(""abc"", 0) # Success!
    Value(status=True, index=1, value='a', expected=None)
    >>> letter_parser(""123"", 0) # Failure!
    Value(status=False, index=0, value=None, expected='a letter')

So - when we call it on a string where it succeeds, it returns an object that contains `True`, (meaning that it succeeded) the new index of the string, the value that the parser succeeded in parsing, and an empty error string.

When it fails, it returns an object that contains `False`, (meaning that it failed) the new index of the string, (which, for this parser, is the same as the index that it was passed, meaning that it didn't consume anything) an empty value, and an error string.

Another one is `parsec.string`, which succeeds if it can consume that exact string.

There's also `parsec.regex`.

### Check for Understanding

What is this?

    digit_parser = parsec.digit()

And when I call it on

    digit_parser(""abc"", 0)

what should I get?

## Combining Parsers

A parser that only recognizes a single character isn't very useful, is it? `parsec` defines functions that take parsers and **return other parsers**. For example, `parsec.many` takes a parser `p` as an argument, and returns another parser that succeeds if it can apply `p` 0 or more times, putting the result into a list.

    >>> many_letters = parsec.many(letter_parser)
    >>> many_letters(""abc"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=3, value=['a', 'b', 'c'], expected=None)

Another one that is important is `joint`, which allows you to combine two or more parsers into one parser that applies each parser in sequence, putting the result into a tuple.

    >>> letter_then_digit = parsec.joint(letter_parser, digit_parser)
    >>> letter_then_digit(""a1xxxx"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=2, value=('a', '1'), expected=None)

One more is `parsec.many1`, which is like `many` except it demands at least one successful application of `p` (meaning that unlike `many`, it can fail).

## Infix Operators

`joint` is implemented as `+`, so we can rewrite `letter_then_digit` as

    >>> letter_then_digit = letter_parser + digit_parser
    >>> letter_then_digit(""a1xxxx"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=2, value=('a', '1'), expected=None)

A couple that come from Haskell are `>>` and `<<`, which are **not** shift operators. Rather, they mean ""sequentially compose, and then ignore."" The expression on the big end of the angle brackets is **discarded**. Thus, the following parser succeeds on 0 or more letters inside parentheses, **discarding the parentheses as part of the result value**:

    >>> paren_letters = parsec.string(""("") >> many_letters << parsec.string("")"")
    >>> paren_letters(""(abcd)xxxxxx"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=6, value=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], expected=None)

## Mapping the Result

Lists and tuples can be cumbersome. I generally want to convert them to some other value. We do that with `parsecmap`, which takes a parser `p` and a function `f` and returns another parser that calls `f` on the result.

    >>> int_parser = parsec.parsecmap(parsec.many1(digit_parser), lambda lst: int(''.join(lst)))
    >>> int_parser(""123xxxx"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=3, value=123, expected=None)

Note the integer value inside `value` - that's an integer, not a list or a string.

### ZALGO! ZALGO! ZALGO!

The operator that's absolutely misused in the Python implementation of `parsec` is the `>=` operator. This is an implementation of the ""bind"" operator `>>=` in Haskell, which is possibly the least descriptive name ever. `p >= function` returns a parser that does the following:

* Run `p`.
* If it succeeds, pass the resulting value to `function`, which is a function that takes the result and *returns another parser*.
* Run that resulting parser.

Thus, the following parser succeeds on *double letters*.

    >>> double_letter = letter_parser >= (lambda s: parsec.parsecmap(parsec.string(s), lambda s2: f""{s}{s2}""))
    >>> double_letter(""aa12345"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=2, value='aa', expected=None)

If you squint hard enough, you might recognize that we've *bound* the result of `letter_parser` to `s` inside the scope of the lambda function, hence the name of the ""bind"" operator.

Don't do this. Just use `parsec.bind`. It just looks *wrong* in Python.

Okay, so we've described this crazy-ass library that implements parsing with a few primitive parsers. How do we actually use this in a non-trivial example?

Well, it starts easy and becomes hard!

## Literals

First off, we start with a combinator that *optionally* applies a parser, succeeding either way. This is for stuff like an optional decimal point - a float might have one, or it might not. Again, this function returns another parser:

    def opt(parser):
        return parsec.times(parser, 0, 1).parsecmap(''.join)

Next, we define our `digits` parser, which is just looking for 1 or more digits:

    def digits():
        return parsec.many1(parsec.digit()).parsecmap(''.join)

And our first actual parser that we're going to use in our program just maps the above to `int`.

    def p_integer():
        return digits().parsecmap(int)

### `p_float`

`p_float` is complicated because the Python standard allows a whole bunch of different formats. All of these are floats:

    .123
    123.45
    123.

So - `fraction` matches on a decimal point and 1 or more digits. `p_float` then has optional digits before the decimal point, plus `fraction`, **or** it is `digits` with a decimal point at the end.

`^` is **choice with backtracking**. If the first parser fails, then it backtracks to where the first parser started and runs the second parser.

### `p_literal`

Yet again, we use `^` to choose either `p_integer` or `p_float`.

## Classes

We're going to `parsecmap` parsers below this into objects that can be **evaluated**. The various `BinaryOp` subclasses define how that evaluation is done. In general, it recursively evaluates its arguments, (which themselves might be `Op`s, which recursively evaluate their own arguments or `Literal`s, which evaluate to themselves) and then applies the function on the resulting values.

Because I have the possibility of **assigning variables**, `eval` actually returns two things - a return value and a new dictionary that reflects the new variable state.

## A Context-Free Grammar

This is another academic concept - we define a *grammar* that contains *generators*, and we implement a parser for each of the generators.

The `A` term is the ""Addition"" generator, which expands to

    M + M | M - M

where `M` is the ""Multiplication"" generator. `|` implies choice. And `M` is

    E * E | E / E

where `E` is the ""Exponentiation"" generator. 

At the end of this, we have

    P -> ( A ) | literal

which can either terminate on a literal, or recurse right back to an Addition generator inside parentheses.

The rules surrounding this implement **operator precedence** - in this case, PEMDAS.

### But that's not the actual grammar!

The problem is that parser combinators, at least without additional work, cannot support *left-recursive grammars* without ambiguity. This is the classic

    x + y + z

problem - do you parse this as

    (x + y) + z

or 

    x + (y + z)

With the grammar in its current form, this is **ambiguous**. We must change our grammar to resolve this ambiguity.

We do this by adding more generators.

    A -> M A2
    A2 -> + M A2 | epsilon

""epsilon"" means ""match nothing and succeed."" So `A` can **either** be just plain `M`, or it can be `M + M (A2)` where `A2` can itself expand into `+ M (A2)`.

This means that the above `x + y + z` expression **must** be parsed as

    (x + y) + z

and the ambiguity is resolved.

## /r/restofthefuckingowl 

So, now we just write the parsers for each of the generators in our grammar.

### `many` is just `reduce`.

You'll see a couple of these:

    return p_assign(recur) ^ p_m(recur).bind(lambda e1: p_a2(recur).parsecmap(lambda l:
        functools.reduce(helper, l, e1)))

`helper` is constructing an `Op` object on two arguments. `reduce` is doing the following:

    acc = e1
    for elem in l:
        acc = helper(acc, elem)
    # result is `acc`

So this is taking, say,

    x + y + z + a

parsing the `x` into `e1`, and resolving the rest as

    [(""+"", Variable(""y"")), (""+"", Variable(""z"")), (""+"", Variable(""a""))]

and then sequentially calling `helper` on each of the elements in the list, building up a single accumulated parsed value. Thus we get

    e1 = Variable(""x"")
    e1 = Add(e1, Variable(""y"")
    e1 = Add(e1, Variable(""z""))
    e1 = Add(e1, Variable(""a""))

producing

    Add(Add(Add(Variable('x'), Variable('y')), Variable('z')), Variable('a'))

### Y Combinator Without Venture Capitalism

We perform *recursion* in our grammar - the parentheses parser goes right back to parsing `p_a`. Naively, doing this will result in a stack overflow as soon as we attempt to construct the parser.

Instead, we create a parser that *contains a reference to itself*, and pass that to the Y combinator. The result is a parser that doesn't infinitely recurse.

### Using Closures to Do This Multiple Times

`fix` only takes one argument. So, we create a *nested function* to capture the outer recursed argument and then call the Y combinator inside the scope of the function to create another recursed argument.",1673475985.0,t1_j3y1mc1,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><h1>Yak Shaving Status: Complete</h1>

<p>The <code>A</code> term is the &quot;Addition&quot; generator, which expands to</p>

<pre><code>M + M | M - M
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>M</code> is the &quot;Multiplication&quot; generator. <code>|</code> implies choice. And <code>M</code> is</p>

<pre><code>E * E | E / E
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>E</code> is the &quot;Exponentiation&quot; generator. </p>

<p>At the end of this, we have</p>

<pre><code>P -&gt; ( A ) | literal
</code></pre>

<p>which can either terminate on a literal, or recurse right back to an Addition generator inside parentheses.</p>

<p>The rules surrounding this implement <strong>operator precedence</strong> - in this case, PEMDAS.</p>

<h3>But that&#39;s not the actual grammar!</h3>

<p>The problem is that parser combinators, at least without additional work, cannot support <em>left-recursive grammars</em> without ambiguity. This is the classic</p>

<pre><code>x + y + z
</code></pre>

<p>problem - do you parse this as</p>

<pre><code>(x + y) + z
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>x + (y + z)
</code></pre>

<p>With the grammar in its current form, this is <strong>ambiguous</strong>. We must change our grammar to resolve this ambiguity.</p>

<p>We do this by adding more generators.</p>

<pre><code>A -&gt; M A2
A2 -&gt; + M A2 | epsilon
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;epsilon&quot; means &quot;match nothing and succeed.&quot; So <code>A</code> can <strong>either</strong> be just plain <code>M</code>, or it can be <code>M + M (A2)</code> where <code>A2</code> can itself expand into <code>+ M (A2)</code>.</p>

<p>This means that the above <code>x + y + z</code> expression <strong>must</strong> be parsed as</p>

<pre><code>(x + y) + z
</code></pre>

<p>and the ambiguity is resolved.</p>

<h2><a href=""/r/restofthefuckingowl"">/r/restofthefuckingowl</a></h2>

<p>So, now we just write the parsers for each of the generators in our grammar.</p>

<h3><code>many</code> is just <code>reduce</code>.</h3>

<p>You&#39;ll see a couple of these:</p>

<pre><code>return p_assign(recur) ^ p_m(recur).bind(lambda e1: p_a2(recur).parsecmap(lambda l:
    functools.reduce(helper, l, e1)))
</code></pre>

<p><code>helper</code> is constructing an <code>Op</code> object on two arguments. <code>reduce</code> is doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>acc = e1
for elem in l:
    acc = helper(acc, elem)
# result is `acc`
</code></pre>

<p>So this is taking, say,</p>

<pre><code>x + y + z + a
</code></pre>

<p>parsing the <code>x</code> into <code>e1</code>, and resolving the rest as</p>

<pre><code>[(&quot;+&quot;, Variable(&quot;y&quot;)), (&quot;+&quot;, Variable(&quot;z&quot;)), (&quot;+&quot;, Variable(&quot;a&quot;))]
</code></pre>

<p>and then sequentially calling <code>helper</code> on each of the elements in the list, building up a single accumulated parsed value. Thus we get</p>

<pre><code>e1 = Variable(&quot;x&quot;)
e1 = Add(e1, Variable(&quot;y&quot;)
e1 = Add(e1, Variable(&quot;z&quot;))
e1 = Add(e1, Variable(&quot;a&quot;))
</code></pre>

<p>producing</p>

<pre><code>Add(Add(Add(Variable(&#39;x&#39;), Variable(&#39;y&#39;)), Variable(&#39;z&#39;)), Variable(&#39;a&#39;))
</code></pre>

<h3>Y Combinator Without Venture Capitalism</h3>

<p>We perform <em>recursion</em> in our grammar - the parentheses parser goes right back to parsing <code>p_a</code>. Naively, doing this will result in a stack overflow as soon as we attempt to construct the parser.</p>

<p>Instead, we create a parser that <em>contains a reference to itself</em>, and pass that to the Y combinator. The result is a parser that doesn&#39;t infinitely recurse.</p>

<h3>Using Closures to Do This Multiple Times</h3>

<p><code>fix</code> only takes one argument. So, we create a <em>nested function</em> to capture the outer recursed argument and then call the Y combinator inside the scope of the function to create another recursed argument.</p>

Somewhat contrary to what others have said (and we all know what they mean but this may be confusing for beginners), JavaScript already has types.  So saying TypeScript is JavaScript with types doesn't really help imho.

let status = true; // Sets the value of status to true which is a boolean

let name = ""Dave""; // Sets the value of name to Dave which is a string

cost user = { ""status"": true, ""name"": ""Dave"" }; // Sets the value of user to an object.

There are 8 types in total.  7 primative (undefined, null, bool, number, bigInt, string, symbol) and 1 compound (object, of which functions and arrays are special types of).

So JavaScript has types.  But notice that no type was explicitly declared in the code. The JavaScript engine does this for us. JavaScript also enables us to change the type of whatever is initially assigned.  This can result in various bugs.

status = ""true""; // Status is now set to be a string.  This is fine...but could cause sutlbe bugs if the type is being relied upon later.

Some developers prefer to work with statically typed languages.  This means that types can be explicitly set in the code and can't be changed.

This is what TypeScript introduces.

let status: boolean = true;

Now status is explicitly set to a boolean and typescript will tell you when something attempts to change it.  This way you can be sure in future that status is and remains a boolean.

One other important thing to understand is that TypeScript isn't really a separate language.  It is a superset that is compiled down to JavaScript.

If you want to know more in a beginner friendly way this is a good place to start: https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/

In JavaScript you need never declare a type (you can't) which is both good and bad, depending.  In TypeScript, you must declare a type.  e.g.

    // javascript
    const foo = x => x + x;

    // typescript
    const foo = (x: number) => x + x; // the return type, also number, can be inferred

No it isn't an @ sign or similar.

It is a type which guarantees uniqueness.  There is no literal form so the underlying structure isn't transparent.  

Each time a symbol is created it is guaranteed to be different from all others.

Imagine a random number generator, but the number is always different from any other number generated, and you can't see the number, and it may not be a number, and you can't change it.  All you know is that it is unique.

I get that it is still embarrassing, so you should also be prepared to ask a lot of questions about their expectations, and if you feel like any part of the job is something you're not sure you can do yet, tell them and ask about whether that would be something you are expected to know beforehand or just something they are able and willing to help you learn on the job.

<p>I get that it is still embarrassing, so you should also be prepared to ask a lot of questions about their expectations, and if you feel like any part of the job is something you&#39;re not sure you can do yet, tell them and ask about whether that would be something you are expected to know beforehand or just something they are able and willing to help you learn on the job.</p>

<p>This may lead to you losing some opportunities because you&#39;re highlighting parts you aren&#39;t skilled in specifically (but, it also does show you&#39;re being thoughtful and honest about your own skill level). But, if you&#39;re at the point where you would otherwise be too afraid to apply in case you get hired somewhere you shouldn&#39;t, why not just apply and make sure they know fully where you are at, and let them decide?</p>

***They want to improve their chances of landing a job***

Sure, you don’t need a degree to land a programming job, but having a degree does improve your chances. 

***They want to develop their skills***

A computer science degree isn’t focused on programming but theory. The material you learn from a computer science degree will help improve your skills as a programmer in your job. 

***They want to fill in their gaps***

Self-teaching will most likely cause one to have gaps in their knowledge, and getting a computer science degree is a great way to fill in those gaps. 

***They want to move into a roel that requires a degree***

Some roles require you to have a degree, and you can’t get them or it’s gonna to be extremely hard to without a degree. 

***It’s a better use of their time***

Getting a computer science degree can be a better use of their time vs trial & error with self-teaching. 

###Computer Science Degree option via WGU

With schools like WGU which allow one to get a a Bachelor’s in Computer Science in less than 4 years, and for a lot less money compared to a traditional university; the idea of getting a computer science degree isn’t that bad. 

- Example: One can get a BS in Computer Science from WGU in ~12 months or less for ~$8k or less.

###My Experience 

I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Art in 2022. I spent time after working my full-time job studying programming, JavaScript, then applied for an internal posting for a programming role at my job. I passed the interview & got the job, but I knew I needed to improve a lot after my interview. 

After being in my role for a few months, I still knew I had a lot to learn & gaps in my knowledge. So, after a few months I started looking into getting a BS in Computer Science or Software Engineering from WGU.

What matters is all the knowledge, skills, experience and connections that come with it. For sure one can get 99% done and drop out just before his Bachelor thesis, before his thesis defense or can just fail the defense. Leaving failing the defense aside (as then one really sucks in his knowledge and skills) then with quitting before the thesis or before the defense can still leave the person with all the knowledge and skills he acquired during his studies.

So, a degree alone does not really help. Sure, in some places an ability to show that paper/title can be helpful. But in general your own knowledge and skills matter.

Now, from where one will get these skills and knowledge? From university. University will provide you with a set path that has different necessary courses. If a person is learning on his own then he does not know what he does not know nor he knows what he has to know. His choices are subjective. But when he goes to a university then professors there will know what he has to know/learn and will teach him that.

Another thing is connections. Are you getting different useful connections from some online course/bootcamp? Usually no.

Then your github portfolio and projects in it. When you are studying in a university then most likely your projects will be on much higher level.

Now chemistry students and professors are using my software in their lab experiments. Some other students worked on a self-driving bus project. I dare you to show me a bootcamp that produces such real life projects.

Then bootcamps itself. Usually aimed for web application developers. But web application development is only one field of many. What about applied cryptography? What about embedded programming?

>Have 5-10+ years of experience in scalable, multi-tenant environments.

That is from a job a recruiter reached out to me with on linked in. It pays a base of 200+ but the whole description mentions nothing about any type of degree. I turned it down because it's a lead on a smaller team of just 6 people. The point is that if you see a company that won't hire or promote you because you don't have a college degree then run and never look back.

One industry secret that people don't know is that a college degree becomes irrelevant after the first few years because everyone has had a chance to prove their actual real-world productivity and skills by then.

With 3 years of experience, my advice is for you to continue upskilling yourself. You should be aiming to become a senior in the next 2 years if you aren't one already.   


Below are just a few tips and skills that I think you should already know or take the time to know. It doesn't matter if you identify yourself as a front-end or backend engineer at a senior level you should have a working to expert level of some of the following.

&#x200B;

* Data structures and algorithms - The level of depth you go into depends on your company or your own goals.
* HTTP/S - Types of requests, headers, cookies, caching, error codes, etc.
* Authentication and authorization - Oauth, JWTs, sessions, SAML etc
* Authentication and authorization - Oauth, JWTs, sessions, SAML, etc
* Browser developer tools.
* Software design patterns - SOLID etc
* Unit and integration testing.
* Build tools - Linters, CI/CD 
* Application observability and monitoring - Splunk etc.

The `return` keyword serves, generally, two purposes:

Firstly, it ""sends back"" some value at the end of a function's run. Remember that ""functions"" in programming are basically pre-packaged, re-runnable bits of code that you can call whenever you want. So, for example, we have a (paraphrased!) method in my company's codebase named `removeMillisecondsFromTimestamp()`. Since, in a lot of places, we don't explicitly *care* about milliseconds, this function simply takes a timestamp and rounds the seconds down to the nearest integer. So this function takes an input ('2023-01-20T07:37:50.1234Z'), and *returns* that value without its millisecond fraction ('2023-01-20T07:37:50Z'). Above all, this allows you to use the *result* of that function elsewhere in your code.

Secondly, the return keyword often *stops* that run of that function at that keyword. So, for example, consider the following function which will divide *a* by *b*, but only if *a* \> *b*:

    public static double DivideOnlyGreaterThanZero(double a, double b) {
        if ( b <= a) {
            return 0;//Yes, this isn't mathematically correct.
        }
        return a/b;
    }

In this example, if *a* is less than *b*, we don't wanna bother dividing. We simply wanna return the number `0` and... stop using that function. In that case, we return 0, and don't even hit the `return a/b;` line.

Not to sound cliche, but the only dumb questions in programming are the ones you don't ask.

Yes. 

The method in the post you are responding to is defined as:

    public static double DivideOnlyGreaterThanZero(double a, double b) {

That is, it has declared that it will return a `double`.  So all of the `return` statements inside that method must have a `double` as their argument.  The statement `return;` with no number would cause a compilation error.

Think of it like this; the first line of the method definition (the one I quoted above) is the ""contract"" that all the callers of that method need to abide by.  So, it this case they must pass in two `double`s, and they will get a `double` back as the result.

2. Static: This function exists on the class itself (as opposed to instances of the class). Don't worry too much if this doesn't make sense for now.
3. Double: This function *must return a value of type ""double""*. 
4. Is named DivideOnlyGreaterThanZero. So if I call (""use"") the function, I use that name.
5. Has two inputs of type ""double""

Some languages like JavaScript are loose or weakly typed, which basically means that you can mix and match variable types largely at will. That *can* leave you in hot water, tho. Imagine the following:

    function additonalCostForUserFromDatabase(user, initialCost) {
        initialCost += getAdditionalCost(user);
        return initialCost;
    }
    additonalCostForUserFromDatabase('HealyUnit', 5);

Now, let's imagine that for whatever reason, the above function can't *find* the user passed to it. Let's assume that that `getAdditionalCost()` function returns the string ""not found!"" if it can't find that user. That entire function would basically be trying to add 5 and ""not found!"". If you're scratching your head at this point... Yes. That's sort of the point.

So how did they compile the compiler?

With an earlier compiler.

The first compiler was written in machine code, very tediously, by hand, decades ago.

That first compiler was used to compile the second compiler, and so on.

That solves the gcc paradox. The first version of gcc was *not* compiled using gcc! That would have been impossible. But gcc was not the first C compiler. C compilers already existed. So the first version of gcc was written in C, but compiled using some other compiler. But then once the compiled version of gcc existed, it could be used to compile itself from then on.

When you invent a new language it requires an extra step: for example, the first version of the Rust compiler was written in another language, OCaml. Then once that worked, they rewrote the Rust compiler in Rust and compiled it again.

BTW, it isn't necessary that a compiler for X is written in X. There are plenty of examples of languages where the compiler for that language is written in some other language.

They have an alphabet of valid characters, and they have a grammar that dictates how those characters can be sequenced to produce ""grammatically correct sentence"".

The first stage in compilation is parsing. The compiler reads the source code character by character and uses the rules of grammar to construct an abstract representation of the language.

The result is usually some kind of tree-like structure (called Abstract Syntax Tree). The branches in that tree are expressions/statements usually identified by some operator, with sub-branches that represent the sub-expressions.

For example, this: `a+10*c` might get turned into a tree like this:

    BinaryOperation{
        operator: Addition,
        left_hand_side:
             Variable(""a""),

            right_hand_side: Variable(""c""),
        } 
    }

&#x200B;

Second stage in compilation is code generation. The compiler walks the tree (usually in depth-first order) and generates appropriate code for each branch in the tree. The output of this second stage is the machine code, or some other intermediate representation (for example bytecode) that may be further processed or interpreted.

>And how is it possible that some compilers like gcc are written in the same language that they compile?

A compiler is just a program that takes source code as an input, and outputs the corresponding machine code. A compiler can be written in itself - you just feed its own (possibly modified) source code into it, and it spits out a (possibly modified) copy of itself.

Off course, this means that the first version of the compiler must have been written in some other language. This is a process called bootstrapping. You can follow the genealogy of a language and its compilers/interpreters all the way back to earliest compilers that were written directly in machine code.",0.0,t1_j3ii1ko,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>The first thing you need to understand is that programming languages are languages.

Even though I wouldn’t consider this a “beginner” task, based on some of your other replies, im going to assume that you know how to program and you are familiar with python at a decent level.

Look into [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification) with keras. Check out convolutional neural networks (CNN). These are used frequently for image classification problems like you described. I won’t explain them here, but the documentation is pretty clear and there’s a lot of literature out there on this stuff.

You have to get a lot of data too though. Ideally, you’ll want to find an existing dataset for images of clothing along with labels of weather, but that might not be possible. I can tell you the clothing images data is real. That’s a common one. The weather labels you might have to come up with on your own for the clothing images. So start small, consider only a few different kinds of weather, like “rainy” vs “sunny”. Find all the clothing images that make sense for each of those & label them with the appropriate one. 

Once you have these, the images of clothing and the labels of weather, you want to combine them into one dataset. You’re going to want to set aside most of the data for “training” and the smaller portion left over for “testing”. Here’s the idea, in the training phase, you’ll feed your training data (combination of images and labels) into your model NN (neural net), it’s going to come up with a strategy for how to guess the label of the weather, given the image of clothing. Meaning the image of clothing will be your independent variable and the label of weather will be your dependent one. In the testing phase, you’ll give only the images of clothing from that smaller portion of data you reserved that the model did not see before, and it’s going to use its training strategy to try to guess the label of the weather from the new image. All of the models predictions then will be compared to the ‘actual’ labels of weather for that smaller portion, and you’ll see how well it does in terms of “accuracy” as well as other metrics.

Ok here’s the thing to remember though. This is the ML/DL side of things. If you want this to be interactive as in real time you show an image of clothing and it guesses the weather, then it needs to be able to ‘capture’ the data somehow. 
There are libraries out there that use computer vision for image detection. This could be helpful. 
You need to have the computer take a picture of the clothing it’s shown. Then with that picture, assuming your NN is trained with many images of pictures, the NN will make a ‘guess’ on that new picture, and then that result will have to render somehow so that the user can see. 

For example, I show the computer a raincoat then a second goes by and the computer displays a label ‘rainy’ to me. So here, the computer has to first get the new data - the picture of my raincoat - then it needs to take that data & hand it over to the NN behind the scenes that’s been trained to predict weather labels given clothing images - the model will come up with some kind of weather label prediction and that prediction needs to be sent back to the user interface - then whatever the model guessed will be displayed on the computer so the user can see it.

Now you might ask, what about those new images though, are they stored somewhere? That’s up to you. You could put those images into a database. And store them, then periodically retrain your NN so it keeps learning patterns and gets better at making predictions (in theory). However, with each of those new pictures taken you’d need to go through and come up with all the true labels for the weather so that when you train it’s able to base its strategy around making weather label predictions (classifications). This could be really tedious. 

I’d start small with all this stuff though. I would focus on MVP for each. Make the NN model
simple. Consider [transfer learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-pre-trained-cnn-models-to-use-for-computer-vision-with-transfer-learning-885cb1b2dfc) using a pretrained NN for image classification even. For transfer learning here’s an example of using google’s pretrained [MobileNetV2](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning) model in combination with training data from ImageNet, a massive image dataset with labels, to predict dogs and cats. Also make the app to collect the ‘image’ from the user simple. Then try to connect the two. The image from the user needs to go into the NN. The prediction from the NN needs to go back to the user. The user comes first, they show the picture, the NN predicts on the picture, then you show that prediction in a human like way back to the user. You’ll be glueing stuff together. Once you got this down for a basic one, then I’d say move on if you want to make it more involved (multi-label classification, tuning, storage/retrain, etc). 

Idk if you’ve seen that show Silicon Valley ever, there’s an episode where one of the guys makes an app to determine if something is a hot dog or not given a picture, it’s probably similar to this tbh. The model behind the scenes was probably trained in a binary classification way, where it was given a bunch of images & then labels of ‘hotdog’ and ‘not hotdog’ appropriately made for each image, then with each new image taken by the user, that was given to the model so it can predict if it’s a hotdog or not, and then the app rendered its prediction as “hotdog” or “not hotdog” on the UI. So maybe see that episode I’m talking about, look @ that app and how it works, and then you’ll get an idea of how your thing could work from a user standpoint.

The biggest type is ""long,"" which is 64 bits, and any number bigger than 2\^63 - 1 is going to cause you problems. They don't handle larger values because there's a performance impact to checking. ""Primitive"" values like numbers can be highly optimized to work very exactly with a CPU's architecture, and having them exceed a machine's specs makes for slower performance.

Ex: Dr. Logic teaches many students at the university of science. He has so many students, he figures he can come up with a program to compute their grades. Given a numerical “grade” he would like to have the appropriate letter grade given back according to the university’s plus or minus scale where: 

         A+ : 97-100
         A: 93-96
         A-: 90-92
         B+: 87-89
         B: 83-86
         B-: 80-83
         C+: 77-79
         C: 73-76
         C-: 70-72
         F: below 70

In addition, Dr. Logic is favorably bias towards freshman. Any freshman in his class gets a 10 point curve (positive). Any other student however, gets no such benefit. Given a numerical grade and a ranking outlining the year for a student in Dr. Logic’s course, return the appropriate letter grade. 

         input: 60 “Freshman”
         output: C-
         Freshman get 10 point curves. 
         60+10 = 70. This is a C-

         input: 60 “Sophomore”
         output: F
         Anyone not a freshman gets no curve.
         60 is below 70. This is F 

Ex: Happy days are those that are sunny, on a weekend [saturday / sunday], or occur on an even date. Sad days are those that are rainy, on a weekday, or occur on an odd date. Given a string representing a label of “weather”, “day”, or “date”, and a weather (str), day (str), date (str) return whether it’s a happy day or sad day. 

          input: “day” “Saturday”
          output: “happy”
          Saturday is on the weekend its happy. 

          input: “date” “21”

I modified grades as If I'm correct the idea to solve your example is to check first index of the number '78' so '7' ('C') and then second one '8' ('+'), however he changed the entire string '78' to `int` and wanted to check every case so I modified it (we will do it properly again).   
He didn't spot the edge case where a freshman might get 91-100 points so I corrected the first condition `points >= 80 && points <= 100` to `points >= 80`, also he didn't split the input string (he knows how to) instead he used the while loop.  
`if (x[i].toLowerCase() !== x[i].toUpperCase())` this condition is from stackoverflow (I also didn't know how to check that in JS)
