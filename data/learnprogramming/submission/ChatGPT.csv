2048,confidence,"And before you all start with it, yes, it shouldn't be used as a crutch to do your ""homework"" for you. 

I'm a beginner.  I've read a couple of books on learning programming, some more specific books on python (automate the boring stuff, python crash course, both of which i need to finish working through), watched a tons of youtube tutorial about synthax, oop, algorythm, ect... But i never really took time to stare at an IDE to try my hand at the couple little projects i had in mind so far.

Yet, here i am, it's the second night i have a ide open, tweaking python code generated by chatGPT, trying tweaks after tweaks in the interpreter and asking every single question about the generated code to chatGPT (why use this, how does that work, shouldn't using this work too, is it better, worse, are there other function that could achieve that, what about modules etc...). 

So much that i'm pretty much procrastinating and not geting any code written. I'm learning, i'm not just sure i'd be able to write it all on my on without messing up indentation, forgeting a semicolon here and there or other things.

But i got a semi smart, semi dumb personal teacher to guide me through the process of a building a small personal project and it is fun. It's also reassuring to see that what i would have probably started with is how it started the project. What happened afterward, i ain't so sure i would have gotten there. Not in a night of coding i think.

What concerns me is that my ""lazyness"" is getting the better of me and getting me into weird hot debate with a glorified bot instead of lets say, adding stuff to a list to cover all my basis. I keep trying to refine the function calling that list in order to not bloat it. Which resulted in that particular case in chatGPT being adamant about the musical notes Cb, Cbb and Dbb being the same. Which is well, not true.

And the weird interaction i just got me that pushed me to post that message. After finaly copy pasting a modified function and it just not working at all in visual code terminal, asking chatGPT exactly how the input function worked because, well, it didn't in the code provided. A bit of code that even with my minimal knowledge of python ought to work, it gave me a long wall of text that could be summurised by one of the oldest trick in the book. ""Did you turn on and off again your IDE ?"". It left me a bit gobsmacked because while i did closed the terminal a few times, even closed the file and opened them both multiple time i didn't think to do that with Visual Code.

And it worked.

So while chatGPT is the tool that seems to be able to do your job in your stead, as an hobbyist that is very reluctant to post in forums with a bit of code to ask for help as to why it doesn't work it takes the role of the teacher, the search engine pointing at the documentation and saves hours of searching the net for some live example of said documentation. Most importantly, it is the non judgemental internet stranger that ask you ""did you turn it off and on again?"" and to which you almost always reply in frustration ""yes dummy, do you think i'm that stupid ?"" but just don't at the last minute, close the page and never open it again. 
Which doesn't avoid the humiliation of having that one thread laying around the internet linking your username to that dumb question for the whole world to see and wonder what was the ""real"" solution to your problem 20y later. Because it couldn't be as simple as turning the computer off and on again, right ?

Anyway. I'm not sure if in 10 years developers will be still writing code or if it won't just be like in Asimov novels where people converse with computers not really knowing how everything works and whose whole job is really to ""guide"" the computer to do what the human want it to program through regular speech, not needing a single keyboard. In the meantime, there definitively a major role for AI like chatGPT in the teaching industry.

`As I mentioned earlier, I am not able to access current information such as the date. I can only provide information based on what I have been trained on, which is a fixed dataset that represents the state of knowledge up until 2021.`

2048,confidence,"I've had this idea for a while now, but haven't been able to make time to start working on it. I'm putting it out here as an ""open source"" idea in hopes that someone can take it up and make it a reality. I'm assuming that this idea is original and has not been thought of by anyone else.

TL;DR; Build a personal assistant.

GPT-3 is a language processing model that uses deep learning to generate natural language text. It has been trained on a large dataset and is able to perform various tasks involving text. ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses the GPT-3 language processing model to generate human-like responses to user input. It is designed for natural language conversations and can understand and respond to a wide range of topics.

One of the main issues with language models is that they can ""hallucinate"" content, generating text that may not be based in reality. Additionally, their knowledge is limited to the data they were trained on, and they are unable to perform any actions beyond responding to prompts.

However, models like GPT-3 (specifically, the Codex version) are excellent at generating code, which can then be used to perform actions.

# The idea

Train your GPT-3 instance to respond using markdown with some added syntax. My idea is to include code within double braces (`{{...}}`). This way, the response can be parsed to execute the code inside the braces and render formatted text.

## Some examples

Here are some examples where ChatGPT fails to provide a correct response due to its limitations. I have included some alternate responses that your model could give, which could then be parsed and executed to produce a more sensible output. Questions are indicated with a `$` symbol, while answers are indicated with a `>` symbol.

    $ What is the current time?
    > The time is {{time()}}.
    
    time() is a function that will be called to retrieve the current time. The final output will be
    > The time is 12:34.

## You can perform calculations

    $ What is the sum of 123 times 456 and 789?
    > The answer is {{evaluate('123 * 456 + 789')}}.
    
    The code within the double braces will be calculated using an algebra system. The final response will be
    > The answer is 56877.

## You can conduct an online search

    $ Who is the current prime minister of Australia?
    > {{get_response('Who is the current prime minister of Australia?', context=search_online('current prime minister of Australia'))}}
    
    The search_online function will use your preferred search engine to search for the question and return the result as a string. The get_response function will then call your model again with the given context and ask the same question once more. The new prompt and response will be
    $ Context: The Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, welcomed Prime Minister Sanna Marin of the Republic of Finland to Sydney on 2 December 2022, marking the first visit to Australia by a Finnish Prime Minister.
      Who is the current prime minister of Australia?
    > The current prime minister of Australia is Anthony Albanese.
    
    Be sure to limit the number of get_response calls to prevent AI recursion!

## Even call other AI models

2048,confidence,"An obvious point: AI's not going anywhere, and we would be fools not to use it.

Another obvious point: AI alone can't solve our problems for us.

A conclusion: AI's efficiency + my judgment seems a better solution than my attempts to trudge through the logic of a difficult algorithm-based problem.

A question: should I even bother learning about algorithms anymore?

A **better** question: What extent of knowledge of algorithms is necessary for me (as somewhat of a newbie to programming), and how much time should I dedicate to studying them? What role should AI play in assisting me in developing algorithms?

My fear is that any effort on my part to develop an algorithm without AI's assistance (for learning purposes, mostly) will end up being woefully inadequate and inefficient in comparison to the assistance of, for example, Chat GPT. After a few iterations of rewording a question and a small amount of modification on my part, I've found that I'm often able to develop the algorithm I was looking for. I'm afraid that, even if I ""master"" the algorithm fundamentals, I still won't be able to bring anything to the table that AI can't. Moreover, there's already so much competition in programming, even without AI, and I'm relatively new to the field (1 year as an entry-level data engineer).

So what is the relevant skill these days: to understand the underlying logic of algorithms, or to be able to articulately and accurately explain to AI what kind of algorithm is needed and judge whether or not AI's response adequately delivers?

I imagine this question will meet with a fair amount of pushback and an insistence on at least learning the fundamentals to become an at-least-passable programmer. But I have to question whether such an answer would be biased by the same sort of conservatism that always informs any field--a clinging to old methods, maybe out of myopia, maybe for gatekeeping.

**Please keep in my that I realize that this isn't a black-and-white, either-or question** and that the question is intended to elicit discussion.

<p>Another obvious point: AI alone can&#39;t solve our problems for us.</p>

<p>A conclusion: AI&#39;s efficiency + my judgment seems a better solution than my attempts to trudge through the logic of a difficult algorithm-based problem.</p>

<p>A question: should I even bother learning about algorithms anymore?</p>

<p>A <strong>better</strong> question: What extent of knowledge of algorithms is necessary for me (as somewhat of a newbie to programming), and how much time should I dedicate to studying them? What role should AI play in assisting me in developing algorithms?</p>

<p>My fear is that any effort on my part to develop an algorithm without AI&#39;s assistance (for learning purposes, mostly) will end up being woefully inadequate and inefficient in comparison to the assistance of, for example, Chat GPT. After a few iterations of rewording a question and a small amount of modification on my part, I&#39;ve found that I&#39;m often able to develop the algorithm I was looking for. I&#39;m afraid that, even if I &quot;master&quot; the algorithm fundamentals, I still won&#39;t be able to bring anything to the table that AI can&#39;t. Moreover, there&#39;s already so much competition in programming, even without AI, and I&#39;m relatively new to the field (1 year as an entry-level data engineer).</p>

<p>So what is the relevant skill these days: to understand the underlying logic of algorithms, or to be able to articulately and accurately explain to AI what kind of algorithm is needed and judge whether or not AI&#39;s response adequately delivers?</p>

<p>I imagine this question will meet with a fair amount of pushback and an insistence on at least learning the fundamentals to become an at-least-passable programmer. But I have to question whether such an answer would be biased by the same sort of conservatism that always informs any field--a clinging to old methods, maybe out of myopia, maybe for gatekeeping.</p>

<p><strong>Please keep in my that I realize that this isn&#39;t a black-and-white, either-or question</strong> and that the question is intended to elicit discussion.</p>

\-There are 10 rounds. The answer to each round is a Medication  


\-There are 5 clues for each round. The first clue is very obscure and the 5th clue is very obvious.

Can I use python (or other) to generate medications and clues? I have a list of 100 Medications, so if I have to provide them it will be easy but I would like to be able to somehow generate clues so I dont have to make 500 of them

* **DO NOT** use resources like ChatGPT, at least in the beginning. It should go without saying, but you learn nothing if you employ AI to do the work for you. The same goes for copy/paste of shared solutions - put your blinders on and focus on distinct issues.  

* Use the IDE most commonly used by your colleagues. In my opinion VSCode > Netbeans but to each their own.

2048,confidence,"Hey guys, 

I just turned 25. It has been 2 days since I started learning to code. 

I'm a psychology student who wants to become tech savvy. 

I chose cs50 course. 

As a psychology student. i know a few things about how memory works and how to become better at learning anything. 

The is how I would implement my wisdom into learning Programming 

My first goal is to understand the basics of programming. That is ..terms and concepts like we have basics in maths i.e multiplication, addition, fraction, decimals, etc. In english we have noun, adverb, grammar etc. \[ these are just terms and concepts that are important to learn\] like ingredients for a recipe. 

I would want these terms and concepts to get into my **Long term memory** aka LTM. Just like we can answer 8x7 without putting efforts because it's in our LTM. We can tell what's a noun or an adjective in mili seconds. 

But the above advice is just a magical theory without any implementation 

So, here's the, **implementation** to get terms and concepts into the LTM

&#x200B;

1. Watch Lectures of week 0 and 1 
2. Write down all the terms and concepts discussed \[ only the name of the term i.e 'Functions', 'Loops'\] 
3. Watch the lectures of week 0 and 1 again, but only watch the parts in which the lecturer explains the terms and concepts. 
4. Watch the parts \[terms and concepts\] you don't understand and Google what you don't understand or ask Chat GPT to explain it to a 5 years old. 
5. Then, after you somehow being able to resonate with the terms and concepts, get some practice questions where there is usage of these terms and concepts. 
6. Then, code. make mistake and learn. 
7. Come back to after 1 week and practice again. After a break, your diffuse mode of thinking will starting doing its work. This is how solutions come to us when we stop looking for them. 
8. You could start with week 2 and 3 lectures during the 1 week break and this will help. 

This is my plan, I would like to know your views too. I appreciate any advice.

I have one big problem:

Nothing works.

Most of the suggestions I find online are just plain wrong or deprecated. Every slight hiccup I come across becomes a massive hurdle that takes hours and hours and hours to figure out and by the end of it I don't feel like I've really learned anything at all.

I spend most of my time programming angry because of frustration. There's nothing fun about any of this honestly. It's satisfying on the rare occasion something works but NOTHING does.

I'm now FOUR. FUCKING. HOURS. Deep into trying to figure out why a simple while loop isn't working in my zsh shell. FOUR. HOURS.

declare i=0

while read line < /cmd.txt; do

echo ""$line"" (doesn't do anything)

echo ""$line"" > newfile{i}.txt (doesn't do anything

if \[ ""$line"" != ""end"" \]; then

i=$((i+1))

done;

Am I really the first person in the history of the linux that's ever tried to do this? Well, no, I've found plenty of other examples, but none of them work.

This isn't complicated code. I don't get it. How can anyone be expected to learn this? What is there even to learn? ""this doesn't work"" is all I know. When I do manage to smash something together that works I never have any idea WHY despite taking note of it and seeking to know.

Everything I've come across said it should work. I even fed it into the GPT chat bot, and while it was able to pretty up the admittedly simple code a bit: still doesn't work.

Like, what am I even supposed to do?

I don't know whether I'm an idiot, there's something broken at a fundamental level with my PC, or if I'm just not meant to ever program, but I'm not getting a hang of syntax. Hell, the more time I spend programming the more I'm convinced that there IS not syntax and this is all some grand kafkaesque experiment meant to fuck with me.

I feel like I know less now than when I started and it's killing me.

I don't know what the answer is, but it's obviously not reading books or watching youtube videos or scrolling through forums, and it sure as hell isn't figuring it out on my own because I've managed to do it all of once in the past four months.

I don't know where I'm going wrong. I don't know what to do to be better. And I'm normally a very calm, very easy-going person but I can't remember ever being as angry as trying to work through problems makes me.

I'm trying to figure out the time complexity of this algorithm but it's a little confusing and I'm sure of the answer. 

My thought process so far was that since the i loop goes from 0 to n and j goes from 0 to i times i, the j loop must go from 0 to n^2, making the complexity for the j loop O(n^2) which would mean those two loops together would be O(n^3). Then I figured the complexity of the k loop is just O(n) since it's dependent on the j loop

However, I tested the i and the j loop by themselves and I'm not sure if the complexity is actually O(n^3), the results I'm getting seem to be larger.

I have an excel spredsheet with all my contacts and some dates that are important to me. I would like to make a program that would read that spredsheet and send me Email notifications to warn me that those dates are approaching. The spredsheet is on a network location.

2048,confidence,"Hi.

I'm straggling with the following problem and I was wondering if there is any more efficient approach to solve it.

Given that we have two or more databases that store more or less the same data but using a different structure. For example:

Database 1:

    [
        {
            name: 'Tractor G2 3.5L',
            manufacturer: 'John Deer',
            hp: 220,
            final_price: '$43.000',
            initial_price: '$47.000',
            discount: '8.5%',
            id: 5991
        },
        {
            name: 'Tractor G4 4L',
            manufacturer: 'John Deer',
            hp: 230,
            final_price: '$47.000',
            initial_price: '$47.000',
            discount: '0%',
            id: 5992
        },  
        {
            name: 'Tractor G4 Turbo 4.1L',
            manufacturer: 'Mercedes',
            hp: 250,
            final_price: '$53.000',
            initial_price: '$53.000',
            discount: '0%',
            id: 5993
        },    
        ...
    ]

Database 2:

    [
        {
            name: 'John Deer - Tractor G2',
            hp: 220,
            liter: 3.5
            price: '$46.000',
            discount: '5%',
            id: 6881
        },
        {
            name: 'John Deer - Tractor G4',
            hp: 230,
            liter: 4
            price: '$50.000',
            discount: '0%',
            id: 6882
        },  
        {
            name: 'Mercedes - Tractor F4 Turbo',
            hp: 250,
            liter: 4.2
            price: '$67.000',
            discount: '2%',
            id: 6883
        },    
        ...
    ]

The ultimate goal is to group all the IDs that correspond to the same product and also annotate the unique ones. For example:

    1. 5991,6881
    2. 5992,6882
    3. 5993
    4. 6883

Please note that there could be more than two databases. I just used two in the example for simplicity.

In order to calculate the similarity between the objects I thought to create for each one of them a list that will contain the `name, manufacturer, liter` and `hp` parameters.

e.g 5991 VS 6881 lists should look like

    5991: ['Tractor', 'G2', '3.5L', 'John', 'Deer', '220']
    6881: ['John', 'Deer', '-', 'Tractor', 'G2', '220', '3.5']

And then apply some list similarity algorithm to calculate the similarity index.

Finally, when all pairwise similarity indices have been calculated, for each product, I will keep the highest one. The truth is that I should also set a threshold to filter out some of the lowest similarities and that way find the unique ones.

What do you think on this approach? Are there any other better more efficient ways to go?

2048,confidence,"hey 

just to start I don't have any experience in GPU programming.

is there a simple way to program the GPU, I know that there are thousands of cores in a GPU so can I create a program to tell an individual core to do a simple calculation without any complicated programming, so that I can have all the cores doing small and simple calculations to be used elsewhere.

I have this program made too collect inputs from the user and interprets them as rain values, then says how much rain the year got, the average, and saying which months have the least and most rain

I wanted to print each month by name not just ""month 1"" and so forth, so I used an empty string variable and a switch statement to fill that variable with what I needed. But it's not doing it, when I run the code it just gives a blank string

<p>I have this program made too collect inputs from the user and interprets them as rain values, then says how much rain the year got, the average, and saying which months have the least and most rain</p>

<p>I wanted to print each month by name not just &quot;month 1&quot; and so forth, so I used an empty string variable and a switch statement to fill that variable with what I needed. But it&#39;s not doing it, when I run the code it just gives a blank string</p>

<p>[Errno 2] No such file or directory: &#39;dictionary.txt&#39;  File &quot;F:\Python Projects\CrackingCodesFiles\detectEnglish.py&quot;, line 14, in loadDictionary     dictionaryFile = open(&#39;dictionary.txt&#39;)   File &quot;F:\Python Projects\CrackingCodesFiles\detectEnglish.py&quot;, line 21, in &lt;module&gt;     ENGLISH_WORDS = loadDictionary()   File &quot;F:\Python Projects\CrackingCodesFiles\affineHacker.py&quot;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt;     import pyperclip, affineCipher, detectEnglish, cryptomath FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &#39;dictionary.txt </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how or why this is happening as I have made sure that the dictionary.txt file is inside the same folder as the aforementioned file?</p>

<p>If anyone could help that would be great.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    `{`  
`continue;`

    `}`  
 `else`  
    `{`  
`do something5;`  
    `}`  
`}`

&#x200B;

My understanding is:

the computer would start the loop and evaluate the first if statement, if it is true and the condition is met it will increment i by 1 and wouldn't execute any of the other code under the first if statement

  
if the second condition is true it would break out of the loop and would stop incrementing i so the program above would terminate or at least that would be the end of the for loop  


if neither the first or second if conditions are true the else if statement would get executed if condition 3 is met and the program would continue to evaluate the last set of if/else statement again if condition4 is true it will do something otherwise the else is a catch all and will get executed. After that i will get incremented and the loop will start again

2048,confidence,"Hello everyone, new here and new to programming.
I've recently been writing screens for a siemens 840d( already asked for help in the cnc groups to no avail). My question is specific to a particular language( easy xml)  but perhaps someone who's familiar with other languages might be able to help out.

<do_while>

My question is this. Is it possible to get ""tmpvar"" to return the value of ""struct[n].left"" instead of treating it as a string,(I have to treat it at a string in order to update [n] ) or does this just seem to be a limitation of this language?

2048,confidence,"Over the last few years I've just been trying to learn new technologies/ buzzwords in the tech community, sometimes looking at job descriptions of the people who I consider to be successful. But following that method has only taken me to be a jack of all trades, mostly as I get stuck in tutorial hell and then jump onto something new. 
I've started with basic algorithms and competitive coding, looked at web development and app development. 
I've learnt some things about cloud. 
Of course I've gone through the biggest eye catcher, Data science, ML, AI and DL side of things. 
I've also worked with some embedded systems. 

For the most part, currently I'm confused what should I learn from the point of view of a successful career. For example, I think I should venture into web dev but all the GPT-3 hype makes me think web dev will be obsolete in a few years. But then *everyone* seems to be learning data science and I think that field might get completely saturated in a few years. I think this sounds naive but bear with me.

I tried to apply for internships and most companies I applied to didn't really care for my tech skills but rather wanted me to solve intense competitive coding problems involving dynamic programming or graphs, concepts which I (regrettably) haven't spent much time on.

The only thing I know for sure is that I really like building stuff, I like building small apps, cross platform and native, like pomodoro timers, habit trackers, WhatsApp chat analysers. I'm interested in a lot of things but I have no clue how to choose one specific domain that'll define my entire career.
