This is **awesome** and you have a lot of potential, so keep learning! Below are some idea-tools to add to your knowledge-belt. When you know how to use them you'll be able to imagine more complex programs and see *currently-invisible-to-you* nails that need hammering. Be patient, be prepared to revisit each topic multiple times, and be prepared to struggle. Ask ChatGPT about:

- loops, functions, objects

- broad suggestions for improvement (ctrl-v long snippets of code in and be vague)

- how to make code easy to read, modify, extend

- modularization (what do your `import` statements do?)

- data types (strings `str`, integers `int`, booleans `bool`, [oh my!](https://youtu.be/-HrfbV16-FQ))

- variables (anytime you use `=` you're setting a variable)

- conditional statements, polymorphism

- how to plan a programming project, IDEs

- version control (git and github are two different things)

- debugging, unit testing

Your program is [2989 tokens long](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer), and ChatGPT can only handle [4000 tokens at a time](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6787051-does-chatgpt-remember-what-happened-earlier-in-the-conversation) including questions and responses. That means it's impossible for ChatGPT to both read and rewrite the entire thing all at once, but you *can* still ctrl-v it all in and ask one or two short questions before it loses full context. For a first challenge, and so that your ChatGPT threads can be longer and more productive, figure out how to store your strings in a database file (like .json) and access them programmatically (start with `import json`) to make your code more succinct.

Forget DAN. It's an overcomplication and a hinderance.

--------

Me: I need to add a series of events to my google calendar, for instance a college schedule.  Is there a script I can use to do this?  There are too many to enter manually but they don't recur forever, only while the class is active.

--------

Bot mentions google apps script. Gives an example:

```
function addClassSchedule() {
  var calendarId = 'INSERT_CALENDAR_ID_HERE';
  var startDate = new Date('INSERT_START_DATE_HERE');
  var endDate = new Date('INSERT_END_DATE_HERE');
  var schedule = [
    ['Class 1', '9:00 AM', '10:30 AM', 'MWF'],
    ['Class 2', '1:00 PM', '2:30 PM', 'TTh'],

    var event = calendar.createEvent(schedule[i][0], new Date(startDate + ' ' + schedule[i][1]), new Date(startDate + ' ' + schedule[i][2]), {description: schedule[i][3]});
    event.setColor('9');
    event.addTag('class');
  }
}
```

----------

Me: Is there a way to prompt the user for the event information?

--------

Bot says yes and gives an example, but I notice it's not making the events recurring.

---------

Me:  Will that make the event recurring?

--------

No, the script I provided will create a single event at the specified start and end times, but it will not create a recurring event. If you want to create a recurring event using Google Apps Script, you can use the createEventSeries() method instead of the createEvent() method.

Here's an updated script that prompts the user to enter the information for a recurring event:

```
function addRecurringEvent() {
  var calendarId = 'INSERT_CALENDAR_ID_HERE';
  var calendar = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(calendarId);
  
  var title = Browser.inputBox('Enter event title:');
  var startDate = new Date(Browser.inputBox('Enter start date (MM/DD/YYYY):'));
  var startTime = Browser.inputBox('Enter start time (HH:mm AM/PM):');
  var endTime = Browser.inputBox('Enter end time (HH:mm AM/PM):');
  var description = Browser.inputBox('Enter event description:');
  var recurrence = Browser.inputBox('Enter recurrence rule (e.g. ""FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=10""):');
  
  var eventSeries = calendar.createEventSeries(title, new Date(startDate + ' ' + startTime), new Date(startDate + ' ' + endTime), CalendarApp.newRecurrence(recurrence), {description: description});
  
  Browser.msgBox('Recurring event added: ' + eventSeries.getTitle());
}
```
When you run this script, it will prompt you to enter the information for a recurring event, including the title, start and end times, description, and recurrence rule. The recurrence rule should be in the iCalendar format, such as ""FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=10"" to create an event that occurs weekly for 10 times. The script will then create the recurring event series on your calendar and display a message box confirming that it was added.

* Related to that, you can use it to generate Unit tests. I  recommend pasting the whole class to unit test, but only have it generate unit tests for a single method at at a time. Tell it to include standard and edge cases. Failing to specify edge cases or trying to do a whole class at once tends to result in poorer testing
* Generate HTML & CSS. It's fairly limited here. It's got to be done interactive and complicated layouts can get really tricky to produce without confusing ChatGPT. So generally speaking, it's very limited here.
* Cleaning data - You can take unstructured data and tell it to structure it. I gave it a bunch of data of the general format: ""name: bob thomas - birthdate: 4/2/1984 - birthplace: Washington DC"" and just told it to make a CSV file out of it. I had other data where numeric and text data was mixed in a column and I told it how to fix those and it did. 
* Converting data from one format to another: Convert a CSV to XML or JSON or whatever. 
* Generating mock data: You can give it a data structure/class and tell it to generate mock data that's compatible. 
* Explain code: Give it uncommented code and ask it what that code does. It really excels at this. I gave it a class from a library I wrote. From just seeing that class, it was able to determine what the overall library did and then explained where this class fit into the puzzle. I was blown away.
* Document code: Want inline documentation for code? Piece of cake.
* Code conversion: Got code for one library and want to migrate to another one? Use ChatGPT. Example: Converting unit tests from nUnit to xUnit. 
* Finding bugs: Give ChatGPT your code and simply ask it to find bugs. It's usually pretty good at it.
* Teacher... I use it to explain stuff to me.

1. Address the problem of hallucination with prompt engineering by being more explicit in the instructions provided.
2. Preprocess a document with contextual information by splitting it into smaller sections and creating an embedding vector for each subset.
3. Use the embeddings to find the most relevant sections to the user's query by computing the query embedding of the question and comparing it to the document embeddings.
4. Add the relevant document sections to the query prompt by prepending them to the supplied query and using a query separator to help the model distinguish between separate pieces of text.
5. Use the Completions API with a temperature of 0 to answer the question based on the added context.

Preach. Domain experts are getting the most out of transformer models across the board. Painters know how to use DALL-E and Midjourney better, software engineers know how to ask about code, novelists know how to ask about creative writing.

You must consider quite a few more details beyond just the bare code itself. I’ve outlined many of them here for you.

You will need a developer or two to set up deployment pipelines in your hosting environment, set up git, run DevOps for your hosting, ensure security checks and monitoring are set up with tools built into azure/AWS and using third party tools like snyk.com.

Alternatively, check out AWS or Azure’s free training materials to get started. Many people also use Heroku for beginner-friendly hosting. You can ignore the rest of what I said until you’re ready to take your app public. If you think you’ll ever hire developers, you’ll want to learn how to deploy cleanly and comment your code if you’re the one setting everything up.

You will also want to set up a local host site for yourself, a test site for QA testing (hidden from the public), and a “production” site (this is the public-facing version of your app). You can Google why these are extremely important best practices. Or ask ChatGPT.

You’ll 100% need at least one professional developer to set up your basic file infrastructure, install the packages you’ll be using, and design and deploy your back-end database storage setup.

ChatGPT can give you guidance here but it will be the “how” and not the “why” - imagine asking ChatGPT tell you how to lay plumbing for you underneath a house. You might say that you have a four bedroom, three bathroom home with a kitchen and ask for instructions on how to install plumbing for this type of home.

It can tell you how to implement everything, but if you don’t know about pulling permits, insulating your pipes, why pex is the gold standard, and most importantly how to install things efficiently given the layout of your home - you will not be able to do a good job.

You’ll spin your wheels just to end up with a very amateur setup that a licensed plumber may have to end up fixing for you, which they’ll charge more for than if you had just let them set it up greenfield. This is exactly how developers will feel about wading into your app after you have set everything up using ChatGPT.

I’m not trying to fully discourage you, just giving you the full lay of the land. (Source: I own a custom software development company and manage development of apps for a living.)

Now the fun stuff. Your app will need front-end designs- as someone who doesn’t code, it’s relatively low hanging fruit to install something like the Hope UI Bootstrap Framework into your application and then get the complimentary framework UI package for Figma. Go to figma.com, get an account set up, search online for these keywords, and make a copy of this publicly available design kit.

Now your designs in Figma will match the bootstrap framework in your app, and when you drag and drop these pieces together, Figma actually writes the HTML and CSS (non-dynamic front end code) which you can find in your sidebar.

I actually asked ChatGPT to explain to me how to install the Hope UI Bootstrap Framework into a system, breaking it down so that someone new to these concepts could understand- and it did a pretty spectacular job.

You’ll need to get better at prompting AI if you want to use it for jobs you don’t well understand, and then you’ll have to continually double check against external sources because ChatGPT is not always right. These are good skills to develop as someone building an app and managing developers, also.

Once you have the css and html for your front end designs, you can attempt to have ChatGPT add the additional JavaScript and Vue.JS or similar languages to the application. I recommend asking it to use TypeScript also, so that you can learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript and have a fair amount of control over this process. You’ll still need a back end developer to “hook everything up” but at least you can make many of the updates to the app yourself.

Here’s a prompt I used as part of this exact process:

https://preview.redd.it/jxbcnszaf1ea1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce0a9d8863e262ae1e64c61770896f098da4b05f

Try using additional commands such as “don’t use industry specific jargon, instead break the concepts and tasks down as simply as you can for someone new to software development who is learning as they follow your instructions. If you must use jargon, explain the meaning and link out to helpful resources for deeper concepts”.

If you want to deploy your app via an app / play store, you’ll want to set up your developer account at least a month before you plan to launch publicly.

I recommend building this as a PWA (Progressive Web App) so that you can deploy as a web based app in any browser and skip over some of the additional complexities around deploying via app stores and designing for mobile. Once you get more experience, your same app can be deployed via both app stores. The only thing PWAs aren’t currently supported for are push notifications on iOS devices - most people handle this via a service like twilio for text based notifications.

It will help you quite a bit if you learn the basics of app design and custom software development- here are a few concepts you will need to understand:

* frameworks and libraries
* APIs
* UX research with your users (do this before building and save yourself a world of hurt)
* UI design for web and mobile
* Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* DevOps
* SecOps
* git
* ci/cd
* happy path
* regression testing
* kanban board / agile project management basics

Final thought: I’m the CEO of a custom dev shop and I also founded a second startup last year. It’s more than enough work and trouble to understand the basics of testing your app for market viability, designing something people actually want, and taking the thing to market to make money off of it.

No one cares about your idea and no one will try to steal it, trust me on this. Ideas are only as good as the person taking them to market. If you aren’t a natural salesperson who enjoys (or can at least stomach) regular phone calls and meetings, networking and parties, social media posting, etc. then I recommend going the technical path via a developer bootcamp and finding a cofounder that can sell.

If you’re extroverted and more of a visionary then you will probably suffer under the highly detailed and technical work required to build and deploy good apps. Just because you CAN do everything doesn’t mean you should. You will eventually have to pick a lane.

\[Note: I make no assumptions about OP’s personality just because they’re already an engineer. Attrition in that industry is high for a reason, and OP might be looking for a creative outlet and not a detail-oriented side gig.\]

If your idea and sales ability are good enough, you should be able to get angel investment and use it to fund the MVP. If you can’t do that, you need to at least convince someone to be your cofounder and help make this happen, as well as run the go-to-market strategy.

If you can’t manage to do this either, take a hard look at your ability to persuade and sell your idea to others.

If no one is biting, you might save yourself a lot of heartache learning early on that this is a hobby and not your nest egg, and then proceed accordingly.

Good luck OP! If you made it this far, you’ve got it in you to build something interesting.

This code creates a body with a gradient background, which represents the sea.

Then it creates a white circle that represents the moon, and a reflection on the sea of the moon with a 50% of opacity. Finally, it creates five white dots that represents the stars, and with a animation that makes the dots flicker.

<p>In this hypothetical world, why wouldn&#39;t a user just create the tool themselves exactly to their specifications? I&#39;m exaggerating, of course: that world doesn&#39;t arrive instantly, and when it arrives we should still expect large-scale productions that individuals can&#39;t replicate. But the loop [user experience -&gt; feedback -&gt; dev reads -&gt; software update -&gt; user experience] is <em>so</em> slow and unreliable for users that some will end up coding their own complete bespoke tools rather than provide feedback. The future is so exciting again.</p>

i only signed up for it after discovering how much chatgpt has improved my productivity. 

so i figured id checkout copilot. for me it gets in the way with the default ""intellisense"" of visual studio, intellisense is the default code completion tool which is usually what i need. while copilot takes over the intellisense and provides some implementations for you which are prettty sub par and often i want just intellisense to finish off the method name i know i want.

there is also the option to generate code from // comments 

e.g. 
    
    List<int> someList = new(){1,2,5,123};
    // from the List<int> someList find the largest number

from that comment it will come up with an implementation, that so far i havent really found useful yet. but im not giving up yet, feeding it comments in [gherkin language](https://www.guru99.com/gherkin-test-cucumber.html) will probably yield better results. basically gherkin is as close to an english to code generator that already exists. its used in behavior driven development BDD practice to generate tests, from that you do your implementation. 

think of gherkin as the bridge between natural language processing AI of gpt trained on a conversation style vs just a an ai that generates code. its much like how SQL language is telling the RDBMS what to do, and it generally comes up with an efficient query plan to get the data for you

ChatGPT is essentially a pseudocode interpreter, it is turing complete in a completely new way unlike anything else previously seen.

I think one of the best way to explain it is that imagine you want to sort a list of 5 numbers. Most likely ChatGPT can do it in a single query. But if you have 2000 numbers, it will probably fail catastrophically. But, there must be a simple algorithm of different prompts to run in a loop that will allow you to correctly sort small chunks of that list, and eventually getting a fully sorted list.

I suspect that programming can be turned into a system of prompts like that as well in order to achieve a fully sentient ChatGPT that does everything. It can use special commands to get an overview of the codebase, navigate the code, etc. has a state machine to keep track of what we're trying to accomplish currently, etc.

I have started a discord work group called The Prompt Golfing project which aims to propose a number of problems and challenges to solve with ""prompt programming"" and create a community around solving these challenges, but it hasn't gained much traction.

Then, run `aicommit` in any of your git repos.

It'll generate 5 suggestions for you and let you edit before committing the code.

I ran an analysis on one of my repos and ~70% of the time, I preferred or liked just as much the AI-generated commit messages.

Here's a side-by-side comparison of my commit vs. the AI suggestions:

* My commit message: Copy fix

AI suggestions:

* Update sidebar buttons to reflect new functionality
* Add surrounding text retrieval to extension
* **Improve explain and diagnose buttons in sidebar (best one)**
* Refactor extension to include new explain and diagnose buttons
* Add error diagnosis functionality to sidebar

A blue screen of death (BSOD) is an error screen that is displayed on a Windows computer when a critical system error occurs that causes the system to shut down. The error message you provided includes a stop code, which is a specific number that identifies the error that occurred. In this case, the stop code is 0x000000FE, which indicates that there was an issue with the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) on your computer.

There are several possible causes for this error, including hardware issues, outdated or corrupt drivers, and software conflicts. To fix the problem, you will need to identify the cause and take appropriate action. Some things you can try include:

1. Restarting your computer and trying again. Sometimes, this can resolve the issue if it was caused by a temporary problem.

1. Checking for and installing any available updates for your hardware or software.

1. Disabling or removing any new hardware or software that you have recently installed.

1. Disabling BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.

1. Starting your computer in Safe Mode and attempting to identify and resolve the issue from there.

If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, it may be necessary to seek assistance from a professional or contact the manufacturer of your hardware or software for further assistance.

To add a carriage return or line break to your message without submitting it, you can use the ""Shift + Enter"" key combination. This will allow you to move to a new line in your message without sending it. You can continue typing on the new line until you are ready to submit your message, at which point you can press the ""Enter"" key to send it.

Alternatively, you can also use the ""Enter"" key to submit your message, and then use the ""Up"" arrow key to edit your message and add a line break or carriage return at the desired point.

<p>So far i&#39;ve been able to get it to roleplay as a plumber and a veterinarian and answer questions about their business and it feels like i&#39;m talking to any other client. I can then take those answers and get it to reword/expand on them.  </p>

<p>I also got it to roleplay as an actual web designer itself and got it to generate a bunch of questions that will actually be pretty useful whenever I get my next client.</p>

>Hi, I am a novice programmer. I've used chatGPT for some Python scripts that interact with Google and the web in general. I'm interested in using vhatGPT to write a specific script that takes input from a tracked IR bead at the end of a Harry Potter wand and can be used to open doors by tracking with a repurposed Xbox Kinect. I've seen tutorials but how can chatGPT help? What language would that be in?

Hi there! I'm Assistant, a large language model trained by OpenAI. I'm not familiar with a chatGPT program, so I'm not sure how it could help you with the script you're describing. However, if you're looking to write a script that uses input from a tracked IR bead and a Kinect to open doors, you could try using Python. Python is a popular, easy-to-learn programming language that is commonly used for tasks like web development, data analysis, and automation.





Write it

Sure, I can help you write a Python script that uses input from a tracked IR bead and a Kinect to open doors. Here's an outline of the steps you'll need to take:

Import the necessary modules and libraries. In this case, you'll need to import the xbox module for interfacing with the Kinect, and the irbead module for tracking the IR bead. You'll also need to import any other modules or libraries that these modules depend on.

Initialize the Kinect and IR bead. You'll need to create instances of the xbox.Kinect and irbead.Tracker classes, and pass any necessary arguments to their constructors. You may also need to set up the Kinect and IR bead in a specific way, such as calibrating the IR bead or setting the Kinect to track a particular object.

Start tracking the IR bead. Use the Tracker instance to start tracking the IR bead, and get its current position. You'll need to do this in a loop, so that the script can continuously track the position of the IR bead.

Use the IR bead position to control the Kinect. Based on the position of the IR bead, you can use the Kinect instance to control the movement of the Kinect. For example, if the IR bead is moved to the left, you could use the Kinect instance to move the Kinect's camera to the left as well.

Open the door when the IR bead is in the correct position. When the IR bead is in the correct position, you can use the Kinect instance to trigger the door to open. This will likely involve sending a signal to the door's control system, or using the Kinect's motion-sensing capabilities to detect when the IR bead is close enough to the door to trigger it.

Here's an example of what the script might look like:

Copy code
# Import the necessary modules and libraries
import xbox
import irbead

# Initialize the Kinect and IR bead
kinect = xbox.Kinect()
tracker = irbead.Tracker()

# Start tracking the IR bead
while True:
  position = tracker.track()

  # Use the IR bead position to control the Kinect
  kinect.move(position)

  # Open the door when the IR bead is in the correct position
  if position.is_close_to_door():
    kinect.open_door()
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",0.0,t1_izopx7o,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>Open sidebar</p>
