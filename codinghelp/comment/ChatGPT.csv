You can get your post approved if you format your code properly and then respond to this message letting us know.

To properly format code on Reddit you need to go into Markdown mode, make sure your code is preceeded and followed by an empty line, then make sure your code looks as follows (`·` stands for a space and `¶` stands for the end of a line):

····int x = 3;¶\
····if (x == 3) {¶\
········if (x & 1 == 1) {¶\
············print(""a"");¶\

        if (x & 1 == 1) {
            print(""a"");
        }
    }

Most IDEs allow you to mass-indent code by selecting those lines and hitting `Tab`/`Shift + Tab` (for right/left indentation). To copy your code into Reddit, just select your entire block of code, mass-indent it and copy and paste to Reddit.\
If the indents don't carry over to Reddit, then your IDE uses Tabs for indents and you'll need to change that to spaces.

If your code is rather long, or you don't feel comfortable using Reddit's formatting you can use external services, such as [pastebin](https://www.pastebin.com/).

Looking up stuff is a large majority of the things you'll be doing, if you're working an everyday job as a developer.

As you start doing the same routines, again and again, you'll slowly remember exactly how you did it last time, and eventually it will stick.

Your studies weren't for naught, as they taught you the most important thing in becoming a developer - It taught you how to *think* as a developer.

As long as you know what to do when you encounter a complex issue (ie. break it up into smaller steps, write programmatically logic to solve each step, combine solutions to an end result), and as long as you're capable of debugging every step of the way, it does not matter if you have to look up the syntax for built-in functions.


In regards to ""getting back in the saddle"", I'd encourage you to slowly start tackling some coding challenges online.
There's a ton of different websites out there, which will put forward a list of problems, and then request that you find the solution to each one of them.
There are also these so called ""coding wars"", where you'll be putting up your written code, to a solution, against other members of the site. That way you can compete against efficiency and compactness with other members. You'll quickly start learning some extremely valuable tips by doing this.

I'll post a list in a reply to this comment.

Lastly I'll recommend GitHub Co-pilot, if you have the funds for this.

To count the number of different spanning trees, you can use the Matrix-Tree theorem, which states that the number of spanning trees of an undirected graph is equal to the determinant of a specific submatrix of the graph's Laplacian matrix.

However, finding the determinant of a large matrix can be computationally expensive, so you may consider using efficient algorithms such as the Tree Contraction algorithm or the Dynamic Programming algorithm to count the number of different spanning trees.

In summary, to find the number of different network designs, you need to use Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree, and then use an efficient algorithm to count the number of different spanning trees with a cost between 1 and K.

Here is the pseudocode for finding the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm: *Kruskal\_MST(G, w)*:

1. Sort the edges of *G* in ascending order of their weights *w*.
2. Initialize a forest *F* to be a set of n single-vertex trees, where *n* is the number of vertices in *G*.
3. For each edge *(u, v)* in *G* sorted by ascending weight: *a*. If the vertices *u* and *v* are in different trees in *F*: i. Add the edge *(u, v)* to the minimum spanning tree. *ii*. Union the trees containing *u* and *v* in *F* into a single tree.
4. Return the minimum spanning tree. 

And here is the pseudocode for counting the number of different spanning trees using the Tree Contraction algorithm: Count\_Spanning\_Trees(G, w, k):

1. Find the minimum spanning tree *T* of *G* using Kruskal's algorithm.
2. Initialize a count variable *c* to 0.
3. For each edge *(u, v)* in *T*:

* Remove the edge (u, v) from T.
* If the resulting graph is still connected and the sum of the weights of the remaining edges is between 1 and k: i. Increment c by 1.
* Add the edge (u, v) back to T.

1. Return c.

One potential cause for this error is that the file you're trying to play is not a valid .wav file, or that it is corrupted in some way.  
To fix this error, you can try a few different things:  
Make sure that the file you're trying to play is a valid .wav file. You can check this by trying to play the file in a different media player, such as VLC or Windows Media Player, to see if it plays correctly.  
If the file is a valid .wav file, but you're still having trouble playing it with the playsound library, you can try using a different library to play the file.
