I'm trying to figure out the time complexity of this algorithm but it's a little confusing and I'm sure of the answer. 

My thought process so far was that since the i loop goes from 0 to n and j goes from 0 to i times i, the j loop must go from 0 to n^2, making the complexity for the j loop O(n^2) which would mean those two loops together would be O(n^3). Then I figured the complexity of the k loop is just O(n) since it's dependent on the j loop

However, I tested the i and the j loop by themselves and I'm not sure if the complexity is actually O(n^3), the results I'm getting seem to be larger.

<p>My thought process so far was that since the i loop goes from 0 to n and j goes from 0 to i times i, the j loop must go from 0 to n<sup>2,</sup> making the complexity for the j loop O(n<sup>2)</sup> which would mean those two loops together would be O(n<sup>3).</sup> Then I figured the complexity of the k loop is just O(n) since it&#39;s dependent on the j loop</p>

<p>However, I tested the i and the j loop by themselves and I&#39;m not sure if the complexity is actually O(n<sup>3),</sup> the results I&#39;m getting seem to be larger.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m mistaken and I&#39;m right or I&#39;m going about this wrong, I just want someone to sort explain what&#39;s exactly happening here.</p>

2048,confidence,"And before you all start with it, yes, it shouldn't be used as a crutch to do your ""homework"" for you. 

I'm a beginner.  I've read a couple of books on learning programming, some more specific books on python (automate the boring stuff, python crash course, both of which i need to finish working through), watched a tons of youtube tutorial about synthax, oop, algorythm, ect... But i never really took time to stare at an IDE to try my hand at the couple little projects i had in mind so far.

Yet, here i am, it's the second night i have a ide open, tweaking python code generated by chatGPT, trying tweaks after tweaks in the interpreter and asking every single question about the generated code to chatGPT (why use this, how does that work, shouldn't using this work too, is it better, worse, are there other function that could achieve that, what about modules etc...). 

So much that i'm pretty much procrastinating and not geting any code written. I'm learning, i'm not just sure i'd be able to write it all on my on without messing up indentation, forgeting a semicolon here and there or other things.

But i got a semi smart, semi dumb personal teacher to guide me through the process of a building a small personal project and it is fun. It's also reassuring to see that what i would have probably started with is how it started the project. What happened afterward, i ain't so sure i would have gotten there. Not in a night of coding i think.

What concerns me is that my ""lazyness"" is getting the better of me and getting me into weird hot debate with a glorified bot instead of lets say, adding stuff to a list to cover all my basis. I keep trying to refine the function calling that list in order to not bloat it. Which resulted in that particular case in chatGPT being adamant about the musical notes Cb, Cbb and Dbb being the same. Which is well, not true.

And the weird interaction i just got me that pushed me to post that message. After finaly copy pasting a modified function and it just not working at all in visual code terminal, asking chatGPT exactly how the input function worked because, well, it didn't in the code provided. A bit of code that even with my minimal knowledge of python ought to work, it gave me a long wall of text that could be summurised by one of the oldest trick in the book. ""Did you turn on and off again your IDE ?"". It left me a bit gobsmacked because while i did closed the terminal a few times, even closed the file and opened them both multiple time i didn't think to do that with Visual Code.

And it worked.

So while chatGPT is the tool that seems to be able to do your job in your stead, as an hobbyist that is very reluctant to post in forums with a bit of code to ask for help as to why it doesn't work it takes the role of the teacher, the search engine pointing at the documentation and saves hours of searching the net for some live example of said documentation. Most importantly, it is the non judgemental internet stranger that ask you ""did you turn it off and on again?"" and to which you almost always reply in frustration ""yes dummy, do you think i'm that stupid ?"" but just don't at the last minute, close the page and never open it again. 
Which doesn't avoid the humiliation of having that one thread laying around the internet linking your username to that dumb question for the whole world to see and wonder what was the ""real"" solution to your problem 20y later. Because it couldn't be as simple as turning the computer off and on again, right ?

Anyway. I'm not sure if in 10 years developers will be still writing code or if it won't just be like in Asimov novels where people converse with computers not really knowing how everything works and whose whole job is really to ""guide"" the computer to do what the human want it to program through regular speech, not needing a single keyboard. In the meantime, there definitively a major role for AI like chatGPT in the teaching industry.

This is fun 🤩

Edit: wow this is making more waves than I thought. 

For reference my friend does web dev. All day and usually outsources some stuff on fiver etc, when we talked he said some people were asking $1200 or $80 per hour. 

So for him and where he’s at he was willing to spend the money, and to be clear he didn’t ask me to do it for free in the first place it was always a see if you can make it work and name your price.

I think this was his way of trying to usher me in further by saying there is money to be made, but ultimately I saved him time dealing with Python syntax, and he saved money from what others would charge for the service.

The ultimate goal is to group all the IDs that correspond to the same product and also annotate the unique ones. For example:

    1. 5991,6881
    2. 5992,6882
    3. 5993
    4. 6883

Please note that there could be more than two databases. I just used two in the example for simplicity.

In order to calculate the similarity between the objects I thought to create for each one of them a list that will contain the `name, manufacturer, liter` and `hp` parameters.

e.g 5991 VS 6881 lists should look like

    5991: ['Tractor', 'G2', '3.5L', 'John', 'Deer', '220']
    6881: ['John', 'Deer', '-', 'Tractor', 'G2', '220', '3.5']

And then apply some list similarity algorithm to calculate the similarity index.

Finally, when all pairwise similarity indices have been calculated, for each product, I will keep the highest one. The truth is that I should also set a threshold to filter out some of the lowest similarities and that way find the unique ones.

What do you think on this approach? Are there any other better more efficient ways to go?

I have this program made too collect inputs from the user and interprets them as rain values, then says how much rain the year got, the average, and saying which months have the least and most rain

I wanted to print each month by name not just ""month 1"" and so forth, so I used an empty string variable and a switch statement to fill that variable with what I needed. But it's not doing it, when I run the code it just gives a blank string

this is the code

<p>I have this program made too collect inputs from the user and interprets them as rain values, then says how much rain the year got, the average, and saying which months have the least and most rain</p>

<p>I wanted to print each month by name not just &quot;month 1&quot; and so forth, so I used an empty string variable and a switch statement to fill that variable with what I needed. But it&#39;s not doing it, when I run the code it just gives a blank string</p>

The problem was this: 

You have a list of cities labelled from 0 to N
You are given two equally sized arrays of integers A and B
For each index i in A and B, a one way road exists that travels *from* B[i] *to* A[i], where B[i] and A[i] are two of the cities from the list
Find the minimum amount of roads that need to be reversed so that every city has a path towards city 0 (that can travel through as many other cities as necessary, as long as all the roads on that path go ""towards"" city 0)


Even several days later and I'm not sure how I would tackle this. I can't even think of a brute force algorithm, much less an efficient one, and I haven't found anything similar on Leetcode that I could use to learn from. Even chatGPT didn't understand what I was asking and was no help lol

Find the minimum amount of roads that need to be reversed so that every city has a path towards city 0 (that can travel through as many other cities as necessary, as long as all the roads on that path go &quot;towards&quot; city 0)</p>

<p>Even several days later and I&#39;m not sure how I would tackle this. I can&#39;t even think of a brute force algorithm, much less an efficient one, and I haven&#39;t found anything similar on Leetcode that I could use to learn from. Even chatGPT didn&#39;t understand what I was asking and was no help lol</p>

<p>Has anyone seen this problem before, or does anyone know of how I might go about solving it?</p>

the computer would start the loop and evaluate the first if statement, if it is true and the condition is met it will increment i by 1 and wouldn't execute any of the other code under the first if statement

  
if the second condition is true it would break out of the loop and would stop incrementing i so the program above would terminate or at least that would be the end of the for loop  


if neither the first or second if conditions are true the else if statement would get executed if condition 3 is met and the program would continue to evaluate the last set of if/else statement again if condition4 is true it will do something otherwise the else is a catch all and will get executed.

I'm putting it out here as an ""open source"" idea in hopes that someone can take it up and make it a reality. I'm assuming that this idea is original and has not been thought of by anyone else.

TL;DR; Build a personal assistant.

GPT-3 is a language processing model that uses deep learning to generate natural language text. It has been trained on a large dataset and is able to perform various tasks involving text. ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses the GPT-3 language processing model to generate human-like responses to user input. It is designed for natural language conversations and can understand and respond to a wide range of topics.

One of the main issues with language models is that they can ""hallucinate"" content, generating text that may not be based in reality. Additionally, their knowledge is limited to the data they were trained on, and they are unable to perform any actions beyond responding to prompts.

However, models like GPT-3 (specifically, the Codex version) are excellent at generating code, which can then be used to perform actions.

# The idea

Train your GPT-3 instance to respond using markdown with some added syntax. My idea is to include code within double braces (`{{...}}`). This way, the response can be parsed to execute the code inside the braces and render formatted text.

## Some examples

Here are some examples where ChatGPT fails to provide a correct response due to its limitations. I have included some alternate responses that your model could give, which could then be parsed and executed to produce a more sensible output. Questions are indicated with a `$` symbol, while answers are indicated with a `>` symbol.

    $ What is the current time?
    > The time is {{time()}}.
    
    time() is a function that will be called to retrieve the current time. The final output will be
    > The time is 12:34.

## You can perform calculations

    $ What is the sum of 123 times 456 and 789?
    > The answer is {{evaluate('123 * 456 + 789')}}.
    
    The code within the double braces will be calculated using an algebra system. The final response will be
    > The answer is 56877.

## You can conduct an online search

    $ Who is the current prime minister of Australia?
    > {{get_response('Who is the current prime minister of Australia?', context=search_online('current prime minister of Australia'))}}
    
    The search_online function will use your preferred search engine to search for the question and return the result as a string. The get_response function will then call your model again with the given context and ask the same question once more. The new prompt and response will be
    $ Context: The Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, welcomed Prime Minister Sanna Marin of the Republic of Finland to Sydney on 2 December 2022, marking the first visit to Australia by a Finnish Prime Minister.
      Who is the current prime minister of Australia?
    > The current prime minister of Australia is Anthony Albanese.
    
    Be sure to limit the number of get_response calls to prevent AI recursion!

## Even call other AI models

2048,confidence,"I asked ChatGPT about what the compile step meant and it gave a description that sounded very much like my understanding of what compiling C++ code means.  I know that most Python libraries are written in C or C++ anyway because it's way more efficient, so it would make sense if there's code being compiled.  But the part I'm confused about is, why would only that specific part of the model creation be referred to as compiling?  Why is compilation specifically relevant here, when all sorts of Python libraries are essentially just calls to C functions?

I did also Google ""what does it mean to compile an ml model"" in case ChatGPT told me was nonsense and I found an article talking about how the success of ml models depends on the particle hardware used, etc., which again, sounds like the same types of considerations that are relevant for actually compiling C or C++ code.  But what's it got to do with higher level stuff like implementing statistical  modals?  Why would we need to compile the model itself, as opposed to just all the entire portion of the program implemented via a compiled language?  Plus, shouldn't we be able to write code in any tuting complete language that ultimately does exactly the same thing?
