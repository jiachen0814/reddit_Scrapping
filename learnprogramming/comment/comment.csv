Originally, coders had to stamp holes in cardboard to trigger various instructions in the machine. This idea was first introduced by Charles Babbage in 1843, and I had family members who worked like this until up into the 1970's. 
  
The 12-bit ""PDP-8"" introduced in 1965 came with no software, but had 12 levers where you entered the various instructions and variables by flipping the levers, setting the 12-bit word, before submitting it.

Then we started seeing programming languages where you could ""just say what you want"" and the compiler will make machine code for you.

A basic web application or game today typically has hundreds of thousands of instructions and would be practically impossible to code with levers or punch cards. 

In the 80's and 90's you had to basically teach the machine what graphics are. You had to understand the trigonometry and math required to go from a table of 3D coordinates to adressing the one dimensional video memory of your computer. Making a game would often be 75% just setting up the engine at first, leaving little time for actually developing.

Today you can import three.js and start making 3D graphics in javascript with no experience and primary school math instead of university level. The library takes care of communication with your 3D GPU.

The internet is overflowing with libraries for setting up everything from databases and backend servers to front end kits, and cross platform SDKs are actually good now. The internet has set a new standard. Now, you don't have to code for the device. You code for the web, and the devices adapt.

Modern compilers, libraries and hardware has made coding so much more rewarding. What used to take years to develop can now be done in days.

Enter ChatGPT: With guidance from a human, it can speed up coding the same way compilers did with machine coding. It's really no different. It's just one more layer of abstraction, and you can always go deeper if needed.

What used to take days will now take minutes.

Look at how simple apps/games used to be.  
Look at how they've evolved with each innovation.  
Then think of how much more advanced and helpful they will be with the help of AI.

Now, go out there and learn how to be the AI master. You got this.

Your code:

Define a function that asks the user two numbers, then calculates the sum and returns it. Then print the result of the function.

This is absolutely not the same.

In a programming test it would be a 95% fail (5% for properly printing the result).

Your function accepts two arguments, but instantly overwrites them with the input so that the passed in arguments are meaningless.

Looking for complete tutorials will deprive you of the actual *problem solving* as it is already done for you. Yet, exactly this part is the key to becoming a programmer, and even more to become a *self sustainable* programmer.

The code is only the end result, a necessary evil that we have to face since it is the only thing the stupid computer understands.

The really important part is the *algorithm*, the *step by step instructions* for the solution.

A programmer needs to learn to create these step by step instructions. The code then becomes only a final result, a (ideally) 1:1 translation of the steps.

If the tutorials you use are high enough quality, they will discuss the thought process that leads to the algorithm that then leads to the code.

Yet, I would definitely stop before the code. I would stop at the algorithm.

And still, your learning outcome will not be the same as if you were banging your head against the problem to come up with your own solution - even if your solution is inferior.

Maybe try a completely different approach (that I generally recommend everywhere): *plan before program*.

+ Read your assignment multiple times
+ Take a break and do something completely different
+ Come back and read the assignment again
+ Ensure that you *fully understand* the assignment
+ Start developing a *manual solution* - as *you*, the person, would solve your problem - **Don't think about the computer, or a programming language** - this is important
+ Note the steps that you are taking down. Use flow charts, pseudo code, bullet lists, whatever 
+ Be extremely detailed in your steps - every single thing you do
+ You can also start with a coarse plan and then refine the plan
+ Ideally, steps are atomic, i.e. doing exactly one thing
+ Test your steps against sample inputs. Verify that they are correct.
+ Refine if necessary
+ Only once you are satisfied with the steps and only once they pass your tests start thinking about programming
+ At this point, ideally your steps translate 1:1 into code

Browser like examples are everywhere, OSs, IDEs, Games, Social Networks and so on.</p>

<p>Edited. I forgot to note important thing about where in my opinion &quot;Reinventing the wheel&quot; comes from. Most developers misunderstand what does it mean, it means that when you have a project at hand you should not write everything from scratch but you should use a standard library. That is it&#39;s explicit meaning, I as a c# developer would be a moron to reject use of it&#39;s extensive BCL and start writing let&#39;s say LINQ ( which is a huge and good thing ) myself.</p>

Time is precious. Imagine the following situation, you ask, they give the correct code, then you ask more, then they have to answer. You see it's more time-consuming than writing a long answer that explain almost-everything in detail. It's called being informative!

For example, how to copy a list in a python? Sure I can give you a straight answer `new_list = old_list.copy()` But you will never know there are alternatives.

Those who are saying it's impossible I'm not sure what they're thinking. It's impossible as far as serving these pages dynamically, where the ""content"" of the page is combined with the ""template"" at request time, but that's very not necessary for what you're hoping to do.

I recently built my own static site generator for a personal website which you can find here: [https://github.com/plungepool/wiki-dot-plungepool-dot-dev](https://github.com/plungepool/wiki-dot-plungepool-dot-dev)

The generator consists of a folder of HTML templates, a CSS file, a folder of content files in markdown, and a python script. I've set up github actions to run the python script whenever there is a new commit. You could also do this with C. My python script goes through each markdown file, converts it to HTML, and performs a find and replace on the appropriate HTML template to generate the page. Then that folder of HTML files is what gets served as the website. I set up a cron task on my server that pulls the new version of this repo every 5 minutes so the site gets automatically updated with any changes I've made.

For those wondering ""why would you bother to do such a thing without Javascript"" there are several reasons. One is that static sites are super fast and light on bandwidth. If I wanted to I could set up a raspberry pi in my home as a server to host the site without issue. Static sites save processing power by rendering the entire website only once with each new update and are eco-friendly. Some people also just enjoy the relative simplicity of maintaining a site like this, especially in contrast to ""easier"" CMS platforms like Wordpress which can become cumbersome and require constant security updates, browser compatibility can also become complex.

If you decide to build your own static site generator in C, I think you would learn a lot. It's a great beginner project IMO. If you decided to learn javascript you'd learn a lot too.

To answer your question directly: JavaScript allows for [pagination](https://www.educba.com/pagination-in-javascript/).

(4) The database sends this data back to the server, (5) where if necessary, the server makes changes before (pagination likely takes place here; for example, if the blog post has five pictures and only the first needs to be shown before clicking on ""Load more"", pagination sends back one picture, and sends the four remaining pictures only after ""Load more"" is clicked) (6) sending it back to the website to show that data.!<

This is not true. So long as the iFrame has an appropriate ""title"" attribute its probably ok. Accessibility is the only reason I can think of that this would be a problem but even that is probably going to be alright. Maybe if some components contained a lot of links it would cause problems but saying iFrames in general are not accessible is not true.

> iFrames open you up to a number of security risks, some can be mitigated with a good CSP

How are you going to exploit a website that doesn't even use JS?

> iFrames semi-sandbox content, it's pretty easy to escape this sand box, but it does make interactions between content inside of an iFrame and outside of one tricky. Applying CSS, opening links etc. Things that should be simple take on an added layer of complexity.

Thats fair. But I think this more falls into the category of ""there are better ways"" rather than a reason why this couldn't work.

> iFrames will cause a performance hit, it likely won't be noticeable for a simple static site

Generally true but I doubt it would be a problem here. If its just HTML its going to load lightening fast. Maybe faster than a JS solution. Even if its not the performance hit would be so negligible that its not worth consideration.

> iFrames aren't great for SEO, not a concern for OP.

I am skeptical of this. iFrames have been around for nearly 30 years. Web-crawlers probably know how to make sense of them. If OP really cared about SEO they would probably have to make some special considerations to make sure things are optimized but such is true for any stack.

> iFrames don't fully address the initial issue, sure it allows OP to re-use an html file over and over, but only if they don't need to make adjustments to that file based on it's location.

I don't think I follow this one. I am guessing its going to be a simple HTML site so everything is going to be updated by hand with a text editor.

--------------------------------

To take the notes: 

I just used nice plain/simple Microsoft notepad, and a .txt file. (Don't forget to turn on wordwrap mode!) 

I labelled each topic-section with leading underscores, that way to search for a topic, I just put an underscore, then a space, and topic name and it would then jump to that section. 

I also used a series of underscores to create visual dividing lines, so it adds visual breaks and a less cluttered look. 

--------------------------------

This technique does cause a problem however: 

If you're watching tutorials or reading books on a lot of topics that you then decide you don't want or need to know about right now... then you've wasted some time making pretty notes. 

Thus, if I'm not sure if a new language or topic is really for me, I'll just first rapidly/quickly watch the tutorials like you said... and then at some point if it looks really good, and grabs me, I'll begin rewatching and only then take notes.

Yeah I think the main benefit of an overview is so that you “know what you don’t know” and are at least aware of the options out there even if you don’t remember them exactly.

This would probably be a separate section, but it seems popular enough to be worthwhile. Despite having used React professionally pretty much continually since its release I’ve actually barely used Redux though so I might not be the best one for that one.

I haven’t used Java in so long that it would take me an hour to look up really basic stuff. But that’s easy; that’s just documentation. You don’t go to school or boot camps to learn to memorize vocabulary and syntax. You go to learn concepts from loops to I/O to objects to generics. That’s programming.</p>

<p>So, if you’re presented with a problem, an you solve the problem? Flowchart, pseudocode, whatever method you prefer. If so, that’s ninety percent of your work done. Everything else is just the boring stuff of hammering out code. If you don’t know how to cast a string to an integer or how to write a try-except block, that’s fine, because you can look that up. What you can’t look up is how to solve the problem, and that is ultimately what you’re supposed to be learning. Not Python or Java or Rust or whatever language or framework, because there’s a good chance that wherever you get hired, they’re going to be using something you don’t know. And you can learn that on the job, but you can’t learn to solve problems on the job. That’s why god invented technical interviews; to weed out the people who can’t solve problems.</p>

In addition, i keep records of all the codes i write, which language or library it is, in files and folders compartmentalized nice and neat so that i can once in a while look for what i forgot.

I'm a big fan of flowcharting, and it's saved me a lot of trouble over the past several years, because I know what I need beforehand. Some people sit down and they just attack the IDE immediately, and then they go, ""Where do I go from here?""

I look at it like building a car. You've got a lot of parts that go together into a lot of subsystems, and those subsystems have to get integrated into (potentially other subsystems, or) the finished product. When you don't plan beforehand, you end up with a bunch of parts on the floor and a car that looks like The Homer and is held together with duct tape and chicken wire. But, if you start designing by saying, ""All right, it needs an engine. What does the engine need? Okay, now it needs a way to deliver power to the drive wheels. All right, how does that integrate with the engine? Fuel delivery system..."" and so on and so forth. 

So, with a program, you can do a flowchart in broad strokes, like everything that needs to be updated before the next frame draw, or how the computer is supposed to respond in any situation of Tic-Tac-Toe. You divide the overall problem into parts, sketch out those parts, write the code for those parts, and then move on to the next subsystem. Absent planning out some sort of structure beforehand, you're going to work on part of the user-interface one second and then work on scorekeeping the next second and then something else, and so on. You just spend the whole time pantsing it, and you're scattered like an teenage boy with ADHD who's trying to learn in class while the student in front of you is watching porn and there are flashing stage lights everywhere. Your code is going to look like it was just thrown together, and you're going to spend a bunch of time organizing it, or it's just not going to be maintainable. 

So. Stop saying, ""Step one: Open up the IDE and start typing the first thing that comes to mind."" Think about the problem. Ask any of the pros around here if they spend more time typing or more time thinking out a problem or reading documentation. Do they just start hammering away and maybe refine it later, or do they give it some thought first? 

Now, take all of this with a grain of salt, because I switched my major over to Engineering when I decided I really don't like pushing pixels as much as I like controlling robots and manufacturing systems and things that interact with the real world. But, I still tutor some of the students here, and the thing that most of them have in common is they don't think before they start. It's not that they don't understand the language's vocabulary and syntax; their structure just sucks. Duct tape and chicken wire. 

But, as far as programming goes, and this especially applies to the PLCs that I'm programming for one of my current classes, the most valuable programming course I ever took was a flowcharting course where we never wrote a single line of executable code.

    • Read the error message if there is one (Google it if you can't understand it).
    • Break your code apart and run simple tests for each section to make sure what your trying to implement works.
    • Debug, print out stuff at specific points in your code to see if its working correctly.
    • Read your code and try to spot any visible errors there might be.
    • Google your problem, not ""source code for tic-tac-toe"" but, ""2d array not working in python"" or whatever language your using. Usually people have had the same problem before and others have helped them fix it.
    • Ask people for help, theres plenty of communities where you could ask more experienced developers for help, eg: discord servers, stackoverflow, reddit, etc... (make sure you don't directly go to this step, as it can become a bad hobby and asking people for help with ""stupid"" errors could get u banned at specific communities).

Usually by the end of this you'd figure out whats the problem, but sometimes its very unexpected that get fixed very weirdly, for example by restarting your IDE or ur whole computer even.

    • Read the error message if there is one (Google it if you can&#39;t understand it).
    • Break your code apart and run simple tests for each section to make sure what your trying to implement works.
    • Debug, print out stuff at specific points in your code to see if its working correctly.
    • Read your code and try to spot any visible errors there might be.
    • Google your problem, not &quot;source code for tic-tac-toe&quot; but, &quot;2d array not working in python&quot; or whatever language your using. Usually people have had the same problem before and others have helped them fix it.
    • Ask people for help, theres plenty of communities where you could ask more experienced developers for help, eg: discord servers, stackoverflow, reddit, etc... (make sure you don&#39;t directly go to this step, as it can become a bad hobby and asking people for help with &quot;stupid&quot; errors could get u banned at specific communities).</p>

<p>Usually by the end of this you&#39;d figure out whats the problem, but sometimes its very unexpected that get fixed very weirdly, for example by restarting your IDE or ur whole computer even.

An example of my Tic Tac Toe thoughts:

Board needs to hold elements and be addressable, some sort of array is probably best

Pieces need to be rendered as X and O, probably store them as strings

How does the game start? With an empty rendered board probably so you need a function that displays the array, something like:

    def renderArr(arr):
        for item in arr:
            print item
            if item.index % 3:
                newline

Next you need a function for assigning Xs and Os by address, assuming a console input it could be something as simple as:

    def putX(xCoord, yCoord, arr):
        if arr[xCoord+yCoord] = None:
            arr[xCoord+yCoord] = x
    (same thing for putO)

Next you need a function that detects a win, some gameplay loop that initialized the board, handles turns, and ends when the game is over.

Finally put all that into some sort of main file with logic to start the game, choose starting piece, and maybe even an option for PvE or PvP that is checked for in the gameplay loop.

    Arr board
    Str X

I rolled my own version over HTTP, and I'd agree that HTTP expertise is a must for it. Though, there's something to be said for learning all the nitty gritty ways to tailor your keep-alive packets to avoid various networks, OS, and applications from dropping the TCP connection on you, while avoiding excessive bandwidth use.

Keep-Alive Packet Hints:

- Packets are usually 4 KiB (4096 bytes) including the HTTP headers
- HTTP headers are only sent at the start of the stream, so keep-alive packets are smaller, though they still need to be carried by full (usually 4 KiB) packets over the wire
- OS and Network hardware only care about packets, and reset timeouts with each packet, even if the payload is only 1 byte.
- Applications often need a minimum of some non-whitespace followed by a newline (`\n`), so `.\n` is a very good payload for a keep-alive
- Make sure you use `flush` on any output to the keep-alive stream, to ensure it doesn't just hang out in the server- or client-side buffer
  - The simple version is just `stdout.write('.\n'); stdout.flush()` from the server and `stdin.read()` on the client. I use `.\n` to signal ""keep waiting"" and `x\n` to signal any other message, where `x` depends on the type of message.
- Very few networks/OS/applications have a timeout of less than 60 seconds; a conservative 40 to 50 second interval between keep-alive packets works well
- It's common for a single user or set of users to all start connections within the same second (opening multiple tabs, network being restored after outage, etc.); so it reduces peak load issues to even the traffic out over time by varying the interval randomly, e.g. between 40 seconds and 50 seconds.",1674353646.0,t1_j5cx29z,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>

If it is a lossless one (or more accurately one that features persistence), for example, MQ (i.e. Message Queue), then the ""Q bit"" addresses this by saving the notifications until the subscriber reconnects.

To use the phone analogy, this could loosely be likened to voicemail. When you switch your phone back on, you will get a notification that you have a voicemail, which you can then retrieve from the queue of voicemails.

From the notifications viewpoint, this retrieval process occurs automatically by the phone reconnecting to the message queue and as a side affect of re-establishing that connection, it will see and thus retrieve the messages that have been queued up. This is sort of similar when you ""reconnect"" to the voicemail service and it will start playing your messages back one by one.

---

There are also lossy (or more accurately non persistent) architectures, I can't immediately think of one that might be relevant except perhaps a weather app.

If you think about how the weather app might work, it is unlikely that every phone, tablet and PC will enquire every so often for the current weather. While not impossible, this would create a fairly large load on the weather providers servers (and would be unnecessary). Certainly alerts such as ""thunderstorm"" or ""flood"" warnings won't work that way because if it did, you might be on the ""wrong timing"" and miss those alerts or not get them in a timely fashion.

But, thinking about weather alerts, if your device is switched off (out of battery or whatever) and you miss them, once they have passed (i.e. no longer current) you don't really want to get them all when you next connect.

So these use a more publish/subscribe mechanism to communicate them (there is a second part which I will mention next). publish/subscribe is like a TV or radio broadcast. The publisher will ""broadcast"" a message such as the weather alert. The subscriber - i.e. all the weather apps, will subscribe to, or in the radio/TV example tune into the frequency/channel) allowing it to receive those alerts. (Edit:) So, now we have a model where the publisher simply says ""Yo, all'ya'all - listen up, here is a weather alert"" and everybody who is listening gets it at basically the same time.

The second part to this is how to deal with a current alert that was broadcast but you missed it. The weather app will (or should) tell you that there is a current alert. So this is the second part that may (or not if it isn't relevant) be used in this model.

So the complete workflow will be that when a, for example, weather alert is raised, it will be published as described above. It will also be stored in a register of ""current events"". So when the phone is restarted, the weather app will (or should) query the ""current events"" register and thus this is how it will know about alerts that are current but were missed from the initial ""broadcast"". Obviously when the alert expires, then the alert would be removed from the ""current alerts"" register and thus if the weather App restarts after that time, you won't be notified about an expired alert (because it doesn't appear in the register any more).

I hope that all makes sense.

Good questions BTW.

The behavior of your code is either too complicated, or it isn't sufficiently modularized and it takes too much ceremony to call into your code.

My suggestions:

1. Use your type system to make certain categories of bugs flat out impossible. This lets you focus on writing unit tests for more interesting logic-related things. [Parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) is an article with some useful suggestions on how to do this in practice.
2. Bias towards writing non-side-effectful functions. Minimizing mutations also helps keep things simple. Push out all IO and side effects to the ""edges"" of your code. Also see [functional core, imperative shell].
3. If your code must perform mutation, try splitting your logic into two steps: one that's a side-effect-free function that decides what mutation to perform, and the second to actually perform it. Focus your unit tests on the first piece, not the second. If the first step is particularly convoluted, I like structuring it as a stage machine. Then, my tests boil down to checking all of the state transitions.
4. Deliberately go out of your way to remove edge cases from your code. For example, suppose your code does one thing when passed in an empty list and another when it's given a non-empty one. Can you find some way of sensibly merging these cases together?
5. Don't fall back to using dependency injection as a first step. Instead, bias towards injecting in the data you actually want. Have the caller be responsible for fetching that data instead.(https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell)
6. Don't push yourself to unit test literally everything. Focus on unit testing the core logic (which can be written in a functional and side-effect-free style) and integration tests for everything else. 
7. Try writing [table-driven tests](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/07/prefer-table-driven-tests).

1. Find a picture of the logo
2. Use an online tool to generate a picture to ascii
3. For each color, use a different letter (B = blue, R = red, X = blank or black)
4. I then either put the whole thing as a string or put it into a list of strings, each list item being 1 line of the ascii picture
5. Looped through each character and printed out the color (text and background)

tldr:  answer: O( n^5 )

our loops are:

    i for 0..n-1
	   j for 0..i*i - 1
		  k for 0..j-1
		  
For simplicity I shifted the ""1"" and used:

    i from 1..n
	   j from 1..i*i
		  k for 1..j
                1
		  
		  
There's a slight discrepance going from (i-1)(i-1) = i^2 - 2i +1 to i^2, but that doesn't affect the O()

So, the loop count:

    i from 1..n
	   j from 1..i*i 
		  j    # sum(1) from k=1 to k=j  

From Wolfram Alpha power series:

sum(x) x=1..n is (1/2)(n^2 + n) giving us:

    i from 1..n
	   (1/2)(i^2^2 + i^2)
		
equals

    i from 1..n
	   (1/2)( i^4 ) + (1/2)( i^2 )

equals

    i from 1..n
	   (1/2)( i^4 )
    plus
	 i from 1..n
	   (1/2)( i^2 )
		
From Wolfram Alpha power series for a final answer of:


    (1/2)(1/30)(6n^5 + 15n^4 +10n^3 -n)
	+(1/2)(1/6)(2n^3 + 3n^2 + n)
	
	
As a sanity check, let n=100.  answer = 1_025_335_840 

This matches the answer that I got by running the code 7 hours ago.

I'm a retired University Lecturer. Over 50 years of programming exp, involved in training for 15 years, then University teaching for 20 years, all the time still involved in writing real-world code and consulting.

My guess is that you are looking at coding problems and recommended solutions. Is that right?

In my experience, students very frequently over-complicate the stated problem. Usually, a problem is designed to demonstrate or teach a particular concept, language feature, or technique. The important thing is to learn from the suggested solution when it differs from yours.

In the real world the problems are rarely broken down to such nice conceptual chunks. The real world is much more messy. A new code base can start out with nice clean separation of concerns, independent modules and classes, nicely layered, blah, blah, blah. And then life happens.

Plenty of discussion in answer to your question focusses on whether fewer lines is ""better"" in some way. All things being equal, I say yes. It is usually faster, and easier to understand. Your code is going to be read many more times than it gets changed. By all things being equal, I mean

* You write easily understandable code.
* You avoid deliberately inefficient code such as 13 nested if else's to work out the number of days in a month.
* You understand \*how your language works\*, for example, in C you can rely on the compiler to do code optimisation, not so much in Python. But in Python every variable is a reference so comparisons are fast (over simplifying it heaps), in C you have to know whether to compare the strings or the pointers. Also, does your language short circuit logical tests?
* You know the libraries that come with the language, and how to use them. They do things faster and better than most of us can (easily) produce ourselves.

So, as a programming beginner those are what I recommend you focus on, plus never leave a bug or problem until you understand it c-o-m-p-l-e-t-e-l-y. Oh, and RTFM. The actual language reference manual. People love YT vids, and looking up code on Q&A sites, but here's a fact:

If you ask someone else, you'll always learn less than they know. Sometimes they're not correct, or have a non-optimal way of doing it, or you get the wrong understanding. Or maybe their answer doesn't relate to your actual problem. So (learn to) RTFM.",1671264523.0,t1_j0kbyv5,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>Ok, lots of good feedback here.

You’re approaching code the wrong way, if you’re trying to optimize based on source form.

For most languages you’ll use—except shell/batch scripts—there’s a compiler that converts your code into some reduced, easy-to-consume form for later consumption by an interpreter, with your CPU serving as the ur-interpreter at the base of the language stack. Languages like C/C++ usually run ~directly on the CPU, but for C\# you have an additional CIL bytecode stage for the CLR above that. The CIL binary is usually run through an A^(head)O^(f)T^(ime) pass that converts most of it to machine code for direct execution. Java (which is what CLR was intended to embrace/extend/extinguish) is usually interpreted as bytecode except for specific “hot” spots which are J^(ust-)I^(n-)T^(ime)-translated to machine code by the JVM—IIRC CLR can do this too now, although it started out AOT-only.

At each level of transformation, the higher-level representation is squished, stretched, or obliterated in order to fit the lower-level representation, which often uses different input/output formats, execution models, memory models, and optimization tricks from the HLL. (CLR & JVM bytecodes are *close* to the original source code in terms of info content, but their formats and programming models are quite different.) Importantly, each of the conversions your code undergoes can involve optimization for speed, code size, communication, bandwidth, cache misses, branch mispredicts, “safety“ or “security” in some guise, or power usage; this is where things kinda take off. (Your code might also be instrumented in different ways to collect data about those metrics as it runs.)

Source code is similar to equations in math, and optimizers can manipulate the structure and semantics of code just like you’d use algebra or calculus to manipulate equations. By the time it makes it into assembly or machine code, your program will usually be unrecognizable without reverse-engineering.

Frexahmple: Let’s say you’ve written an absolute value function, which I’m going to write in pseudocode—but it’d look roughly the same in any braces language:

	public static ulong abs(long x) {
		if(x < 0L) return -(ulong)x; //¹
		return x;
	}

Very basic, could be written any number of ways.

First let’s play with it in context. An easy place to start is giving it a constant argument:

	ulong v = abs(-4);
	Process.stdout.println(v);

Here, the optimizer will hopefully see that `4` is a literal, `-4` is constant, and therefore we can clone or inline this `abs` call by subbing in `-4L` for arg `x`, giving us

	if(-4L < 0L) return -(-4L);
	return -4L;

Here we/optimizer can easily see that `-4L < 0` is always true, `-(-4L)`⇒`4UL` will always be returned, and `return -4L` is dead code (won’t ever execute). So we’re left with just `ulong v=4UL` at the call site, with no actual call to `abs`. Because `v` is now a constant `4UL`, we can eliminate it too, leaving only

	Process.stdout.println(4UL);

If the optimizer understands the `println` call, it may go even further:

	Process.stdout.print(""4\n"");

So the output form (`4UL` &seq.) is totally different from the source code (`abs(-4)` & `abs` itself). —Hell, it’d be *difficult* to come up with a correct `abs` that’s complicated enough to prevent a constant return if given a constant argument, unless inlining isn’t possible.

Another context, getting slightly more complicated:

	long k = Process.stdin.readLong();
	if(k > 0) break; // matters not whither
	Process.stdout.println(abs(k));

`k` isn’t constant; its value can’t possibly be known until run time. But there’s a constraint on it beyond its type: By the time `abs` is called, `k` is definitely ≤0. If we inline `abs` here, we have [pardon notation]

	long @Constrain(<= 0L) x = ↑k;
	if(x < 0L) return -x;
	return x;

and pushing `x`’s constraints into the the `if`:

	if((long @Constrain(<=0L))x < 0L) return -…x;
	return x;

So from 𝛤 = *after* the `if` we know

> 𝛤⊦`x <= 0L` ∧ ¬(`x < 0L`); ∴

> 𝛤⊦`x <= 0L` ∧ `x >= 0L`; ∴

> 𝛤⊦`x == 0L`

leaving us with

	if(x < 0L) return -x;
	return 0L;

and −0=0 so the returns can be merged to just `return -x`, and we can pull that right up into the call site:

	Process.println((ulong)-k);

So in context, the exact format of `abs`’s body doesn’t really matter.

We can examine `abs` alone—it’s `public`, so the compiler will need an un-inlined copy. Although most CPUs would be *okay* with the `if`/`else` form (e.g., rendered directly as

		if(x < 0L) goto $L1;
		$t = x;
		goto $L2;
	$L1:
		$t = -…x;
	$L2:
		return $t;

or with the cases flipped), the `if` constitutes a *conditional branch,* and CPUs do a ton of tricks/“illusions”^(, Michael) to try to work around/through those. (GPUs positively loathe them.)

If the CPU has a conditional move instruction like x86 (post-P6) [F]CMOVcc, `abs` can be rejiggered to

	if(x < 0) x = -x;
	return x;

which might lower to machine code

	; x ↔ RSI
	mov  	rax, rsi	; 𝝆=x
	neg  	rsi     	; x=-x
	test 	rax, rax	; 𝝆⋚0?
	cmovl	rax, rsi	; <→𝝆=x
	; RAX ↔ 𝝆

Because the NEG instruction sets the same flags TEST does, we can eliminate the TEST:

	mov   	rax, rsi	; 𝝆=x
	neg   	rsi     	; F.SF=(x=-x)<0
	cmovns	rax, rsi	; ¬F.SF→𝝆=x

—CMOVNS tests the sign flag F.SF, which is copied from the result’s msb. There’s an overflow case at −2^(63) = `Long.MIN_VALUE` for which the input and output values’ representations match, but then it doesn’t matter whether we choose `-x₀` or `x₀`, and it works regardless.

Another possibility is to convert `x < 0` to a mask, use that to zero out the case we don’t want, and then mix that with the case we do want:

	ulong mask = (x < 0L ? ULong.MAX_VALUE : 0UL);
	return (-x & mask) | (x & ~mask);

The `mask` calculation can be reduced to `x >> (Long.BITS - 1)`,² which fills all bits in the result with the sign flag. In assembly, this gives us

	; x ↔ RSI, m[ask] ↔ RCX
	mov	rcx, rsi	; m=x
	sar	rcx, 63 	; m>>=63
	mov	rax, rsi	; 𝝆=x
	neg	rsi     	; x=-x
	and	rsi, rcx	; x&=m
	not	rcx     	; m=~m
	and	rax, rcx	; 𝝆&=m
	or 	rax, rsi	; 𝝆|=x
	; RAX ↔ 𝝆

which is okay—the dependency graph can probably be cleaned up a bit to eliminate some of the hazards—but still a bit excessive, because we’re not looking too closely at the `-x` part of things.

In two’s-complement representations, which is what ~everything uses nowadays for signed ints, `-z == 1 + ~z`. Because `a^b` flips bits in `a` for which the corresponding bit in `b` is set, and because `-1 == ~0` and is therefore all-one-bits, we can render `~z` as `z ^ -1`, and because `+1` ≡ `-(-1)`, we have `-z == (z ^ -1) - -1`. We can also restate `+z` as `(z ^ 0) - 0`, giving us two parallel cases:

	return x < 0L ? (x^-1)-1 : (x^0)-0;

And, since we can get exactly the right −1-or-0 value from `mask`, we end up with

	long mask = x >> 63;
	return (x ^ mask) - mask;

which renders as

	mov rax, rsi
	sar rsi, 63
	xor rax, rsi
	sub rax, rsi

in assembly. This is one solid hazard (WAR into RWAW×2), but it mixes easily with nearby code to hide latency, and it uses only ALU and shifter units which tend to be plentiful in higher-end out-of-order cores. x86 also supports a couple specialized instructions for sign extraction, so if we start with RAX=`x` we can just do

	; RAX ↔ x, RDX ↔ m
	cqdq        	; m=(int128)x>>64
	xor rax, rdx	; 𝝆=x^m
	sub rax, rdx	; 𝝆-=m
	; 𝝆 ↔ RAX

Finally, if your CPU supports SIMD and `abs` is being batch-applied, it can be vectorized. E.g., let’s focus on

	static void absMany(ulong[] out, const long[] arr) {
		for(uoffs i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
			out[i] = abs(arr[i]);
	}

Instead of calling/applying `abs` once per element separately, the optimizer can knock out 8 `abs`es at a time using 512-bit vectors (as for x86 AVX512). First, inline `abs`:

	for(uoffs i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		long x = arr[i], m = x >> (Long.BITS-1);
		out[i] = (x ^ m) - m;
	}

Then unroll the first loop by 8 and use vector shift/subtract:

	uoffs i = 0, rem = arr.length;
	while(rem >= 8) {
		vec[8] long x = arr[i…i+7], m = x ≫̇ 63;
		out[i…i+7] = (x ^ m) ∸ m;
		i += 8; rem -= 8;
	}
	while(rem-- > 0) {
		long x = arr[i], m = x >> 63;
		out[i++] = (x ^ m) - m;
	}

(Sometimes this can even be done for narrower integers using only scalar integer instructions.) Alternatively, the optimizer might just stop at unrolling the loop—this can eliminate the hazards in the compacted `abs`, without vectorizing, and on out-of-order hardware it’s still possible the `abs`es will run in parallel, but they may interfere more with other integer instructions than the vector stuff would.

Again, we’re left with something very unlike the original `abs`, and it’s certainly not a transform most programmers would make themselves, because it’s at a level higher than the `abs` function itself. This is something you’d almost always let an optimizer do for you, because the alternative is banging out all possible input/output structures in separate functions. But optimization is only possible if the optimizer can *actually see* what you’re trying to do, and if it has the rules to fix it up. If you feed it some overcomplicated, opaquely micro-“optimized” form of `abs` in source code form, that’s likely what you’ll get in your output, whether or not it’s actually a good approach.

<p>And, since we can get exactly the right −1-or-0 value from <code>mask</code>, we end up with</p>

<pre><code>long mask = x &gt;&gt; 63;
return (x ^ mask) - mask;
</code></pre>

<p>which renders as</p>

<pre><code>mov rax, rsi
sar rsi, 63
xor rax, rsi
sub rax, rsi
</code></pre>

<p>in assembly. This is one solid hazard (WAR into RWAW×2), but it mixes easily with nearby code to hide latency, and it uses only ALU and shifter units which tend to be plentiful in higher-end out-of-order cores. x86 also supports a couple specialized instructions for sign extraction, so if we start with RAX=<code>x</code> we can just do</p>

<pre><code>; RAX ↔ x, RDX ↔ m
cqdq            ; m=(int128)x&gt;&gt;64
xor rax, rdx    ; 𝝆=x^m
sub rax, rdx    ; 𝝆-=m
; 𝝆 ↔ RAX
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, if your CPU supports SIMD and <code>abs</code> is being batch-applied, it can be vectorized. E.g., let’s focus on</p>

<pre><code>static void absMany(ulong[] out, const long[] arr) {
    for(uoffs i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++)
        out[i] = abs(arr[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of calling/applying <code>abs</code> once per element separately, the optimizer can knock out 8 <code>abs</code>es at a time using 512-bit vectors (as for x86 AVX512). First, inline <code>abs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for(uoffs i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
    long x = arr[i], m = x &gt;&gt; (Long.BITS-1);
    out[i] = (x ^ m) - m;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then unroll the first loop by 8 and use vector shift/subtract:</p>

<pre><code>uoffs i = 0, rem = arr.length;
while(rem &gt;= 8) {
    vec[8] long x = arr[i…i+7], m = x ≫̇ 63;
    out[i…i+7] = (x ^ m) ∸ m;
    i += 8; rem -= 8;
}
while(rem-- &gt; 0) {
    long x = arr[i], m = x &gt;&gt; 63;
    out[i++] = (x ^ m) - m;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Sometimes this can even be done for narrower integers using only scalar integer instructions.) Alternatively, the optimizer might just stop at unrolling the loop—this can eliminate the hazards in the compacted <code>abs</code>, without vectorizing, and on out-of-order hardware it’s still possible the <code>abs</code>es will run in parallel, but they may interfere more with other integer instructions than the vector stuff would.</p>

<p>Again, we’re left with something very unlike the original <code>abs</code>, and it’s certainly not a transform most programmers would make themselves, because it’s at a level higher than the <code>abs</code> function itself. This is something you’d almost always let an optimizer do for you, because the alternative is banging out all possible input/output structures in separate functions. But optimization is only possible if the optimizer can <em>actually see</em> what you’re trying to do, and if it has the rules to fix it up. If you feed it some overcomplicated, opaquely micro-“optimized” form of <code>abs</code> in source code form, that’s likely what you’ll get in your output, whether or not it’s actually a good approach.</p>

<hr/>

<p>¹ I’m casting to <code>ulong</code> explicitly here in case this is pseudocode for something like C or C++, wherein <code>-LONG_MIN</code> is likely undefined behavior. I’m going to omit it in further pseudocode because it doesn’t matter in this arena.</p>

<p>² [Not an exponent.] I’m just going to use <code>63</code> for <code>Long.BITS - 1</code> from here on. For languages that don’t have separate <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> operators, by <code>&gt;&gt;</code> I mean arithmetic = sign-preserving shift specifically.</p>

Language dependent - a very simple example might be as you get deeper into languages you'll know of multiple ways that you can write a loop and they each might have different implications on memory consumption or compute time. Sometimes the nice syntax isn't as efficient as the others. Performance also comes in lots of flavours: memory, compute time, the time it takes to boot an app, the time it takes to compile a project, etc.

None language dependent - you are perhaps working through a collection of objects and processing them - it might be easier to apply a one-size-fits-all algorithm to them, but you know that some of them have caveats that if you coded around, you could process faster. But that would maybe require deeper branching code paths and perhaps make an already complicated algorithm, more complicated. Obviously there are patterns to help with this sort of thing - but the more complexity you add, you'll likely make it harder for someone else to understand and risk over-engineering it. And coming back to the time to code - if you are well within the tolerance for how performant your code should be, then why should you spend more time trying to make it faster?

I think, at least in my mind, I think about readability as not just how clean the code is to read, but how long it would take a developer to read through and understand a functional area of code. Following that on a bit... I remember a time that we rewrote how an App was bootstrapped into entirely different technologies that were strung together in a convoluted manner.

<p>Language dependent - a very simple example might be as you get deeper into languages you&#39;ll know of multiple ways that you can write a loop and they each might have different implications on memory consumption or compute time. Sometimes the nice syntax isn&#39;t as efficient as the others. Performance also comes in lots of flavours: memory, compute time, the time it takes to boot an app, the time it takes to compile a project, etc.</p>

<p>None language dependent - you are perhaps working through a collection of objects and processing them - it might be easier to apply a one-size-fits-all algorithm to them, but you know that some of them have caveats that if you coded around, you could process faster. But that would maybe require deeper branching code paths and perhaps make an already complicated algorithm, more complicated. Obviously there are patterns to help with this sort of thing - but the more complexity you add, you&#39;ll likely make it harder for someone else to understand and risk over-engineering it. And coming back to the time to code - if you are well within the tolerance for how performant your code should be, then why should you spend more time trying to make it faster?</p>

<p>I think, at least in my mind, I think about readability as not just how clean the code is to read, but how long it would take a developer to read through and understand a functional area of code. Following that on a bit... I remember a time that we rewrote how an App was bootstrapped into entirely different technologies that were strung together in a convoluted manner.

My programming teachers could look at four sheets of code from four different students out of twenty and tell you exactly who wrote each one by the end of the semester.

Have you ever looked at any of your fellow students' code? Even when you're writing the same stuff, there's subtle differences.

There's no functions that are just commented out or anything. The wreckage along the side of the road is proof that you were using that road to learn to drive. 

Yeah, it's totally possible to have a plagiarism checker work on code. I mean, it's a funny thing, that Computer Science students would think, ""How can I get around this thing that was built by someone who is probably better at programming than I am at cheating?""

There&#39;s no functions that are just commented out or anything. The wreckage along the side of the road is proof that you were using that road to learn to drive. </p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s totally possible to have a plagiarism checker work on code. I mean, it&#39;s a funny thing, that Computer Science students would think, &quot;How can I get around this thing that was built by someone who is probably better at programming than I am at cheating?&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;d say my favorite thing about my programming classes was that the midterm and the final were in-class and you had no access to the internet. There were <em>books</em> at the front of the room if you needed documentation. People who bought or copied work, or people who could not function without StackOverflow or asking questions on online forums were just completely screwed. And that&#39;s because they spent more time learning to Google things than learning to program.</p>

You should be fine.  There isn't a dev in existence who hasn't copypasta'd code from Stack and other online resources.  Copying a function and fitting it into your app should not be an issue.

# Parser Combinators

## Academic Background 

The idea of building parsers with functions goes back to the 70s and 80s, but the academic paper that this approach is really inspired by is Hutton and Meijer's 1996 paper [*Monadic Parser Combinators*](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf), where they demonstrate the idea that parsers form a monad.

A lot of this (actually, all of it) is academic wankery - you don't have to read it if you don't want to. But the paper might be handy to refer to when you ask ""Why the hell is this even a thing, anyway?""

## Haskell

The `parsec` Python library is based on the [equivalent Haskell library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec). The most important thing about this is that Haskell has a few infix operators that mean very different things from what they mean in Python. Python's `parsec` library follows the Haskell convention, so some operators will be confusing. I'll point this out when it comes up.

## What is a parser?

A parser is a function that takes a sequence of tokens, possibly consumes some of those tokens, and either succeeds or fails. In Haskell, there's a type for this - the `Either` type, which either contains a success value or an error value. Python's `parsec` implementation implements a `Value` class that is similar.

In academic literature, the idea of a ""token"" is extremely general - it can be of any type. For the purposes of this post, we're going to be very explicit. A token is a **single character**.

For efficiency reasons, Python's implementation is colored by the fact that it's likely working on strings, which are expensive to copy. Instead of returning a substring of the original string to denote consumption, it works on *indices*. You pass it an index to denote where in the string the parser is currently running, and it gives you back another index to denote how much of the string it has consumed. You'll see this below.

## Start With The Basics

At the very bottom of the library are *primitive parsers*, which succeed for very simple things. Let's write some code.

    import parsec
    letter_parser = parsec.letter()

This is our very first parser! Let's call it in a couple different contexts.

    >>> letter_parser # What is this variable, exactly?
    <parsec.Parser object at 0x7f19b8a903d0>
    >>> letter_parser(""abc"", 0) # Success!
    Value(status=True, index=1, value='a', expected=None)
    >>> letter_parser(""123"", 0) # Failure!
    Value(status=False, index=0, value=None, expected='a letter')

So - when we call it on a string where it succeeds, it returns an object that contains `True`, (meaning that it succeeded) the new index of the string, the value that the parser succeeded in parsing, and an empty error string.

When it fails, it returns an object that contains `False`, (meaning that it failed) the new index of the string, (which, for this parser, is the same as the index that it was passed, meaning that it didn't consume anything) an empty value, and an error string.

Another one is `parsec.string`, which succeeds if it can consume that exact string.

There's also `parsec.regex`.

### Check for Understanding

What is this?

    digit_parser = parsec.digit()

And when I call it on

    digit_parser(""abc"", 0)

what should I get?

## Combining Parsers

A parser that only recognizes a single character isn't very useful, is it? `parsec` defines functions that take parsers and **return other parsers**. For example, `parsec.many` takes a parser `p` as an argument, and returns another parser that succeeds if it can apply `p` 0 or more times, putting the result into a list.

    >>> many_letters = parsec.many(letter_parser)
    >>> many_letters(""abc"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=3, value=['a', 'b', 'c'], expected=None)

Another one that is important is `joint`, which allows you to combine two or more parsers into one parser that applies each parser in sequence, putting the result into a tuple.

    >>> letter_then_digit = parsec.joint(letter_parser, digit_parser)
    >>> letter_then_digit(""a1xxxx"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=2, value=('a', '1'), expected=None)

One more is `parsec.many1`, which is like `many` except it demands at least one successful application of `p` (meaning that unlike `many`, it can fail).

## Infix Operators

`joint` is implemented as `+`, so we can rewrite `letter_then_digit` as

    >>> letter_then_digit = letter_parser + digit_parser
    >>> letter_then_digit(""a1xxxx"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=2, value=('a', '1'), expected=None)

A couple that come from Haskell are `>>` and `<<`, which are **not** shift operators. Rather, they mean ""sequentially compose, and then ignore."" The expression on the big end of the angle brackets is **discarded**. Thus, the following parser succeeds on 0 or more letters inside parentheses, **discarding the parentheses as part of the result value**:

    >>> paren_letters = parsec.string(""("") >> many_letters << parsec.string("")"")
    >>> paren_letters(""(abcd)xxxxxx"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=6, value=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], expected=None)

## Mapping the Result

Lists and tuples can be cumbersome. I generally want to convert them to some other value. We do that with `parsecmap`, which takes a parser `p` and a function `f` and returns another parser that calls `f` on the result.

    >>> int_parser = parsec.parsecmap(parsec.many1(digit_parser), lambda lst: int(''.join(lst)))
    >>> int_parser(""123xxxx"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=3, value=123, expected=None)

Note the integer value inside `value` - that's an integer, not a list or a string.

### ZALGO! ZALGO! ZALGO!

The operator that's absolutely misused in the Python implementation of `parsec` is the `>=` operator. This is an implementation of the ""bind"" operator `>>=` in Haskell, which is possibly the least descriptive name ever. `p >= function` returns a parser that does the following:

* Run `p`.
* If it succeeds, pass the resulting value to `function`, which is a function that takes the result and *returns another parser*.
* Run that resulting parser.

Thus, the following parser succeeds on *double letters*.

    >>> double_letter = letter_parser >= (lambda s: parsec.parsecmap(parsec.string(s), lambda s2: f""{s}{s2}""))
    >>> double_letter(""aa12345"", 0)
    Value(status=True, index=2, value='aa', expected=None)

If you squint hard enough, you might recognize that we've *bound* the result of `letter_parser` to `s` inside the scope of the lambda function, hence the name of the ""bind"" operator.

Don't do this. Just use `parsec.bind`. It just looks *wrong* in Python.

<h1>Parser Combinators</h1>

<h2>Academic Background</h2>

<p>The idea of building parsers with functions goes back to the 70s and 80s, but the academic paper that this approach is really inspired by is Hutton and Meijer&#39;s 1996 paper <a href=""https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/%7Epszgmh/monparsing.pdf""><em>Monadic Parser Combinators</em></a>, where they demonstrate the idea that parsers form a monad.</p>

<p>A lot of this (actually, all of it) is academic wankery - you don&#39;t have to read it if you don&#39;t want to. But the paper might be handy to refer to when you ask &quot;Why the hell is this even a thing, anyway?&quot;</p>

<h2>Haskell</h2>

<p>The <code>parsec</code> Python library is based on the <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec"">equivalent Haskell library</a>. The most important thing about this is that Haskell has a few infix operators that mean very different things from what they mean in Python. Python&#39;s <code>parsec</code> library follows the Haskell convention, so some operators will be confusing. I&#39;ll point this out when it comes up.</p>

<h2>What is a parser?</h2>

<p>A parser is a function that takes a sequence of tokens, possibly consumes some of those tokens, and either succeeds or fails. In Haskell, there&#39;s a type for this - the <code>Either</code> type, which either contains a success value or an error value. Python&#39;s <code>parsec</code> implementation implements a <code>Value</code> class that is similar.</p>

<p>In academic literature, the idea of a &quot;token&quot; is extremely general - it can be of any type. For the purposes of this post, we&#39;re going to be very explicit. A token is a <strong>single character</strong>.</p>

<p>For efficiency reasons, Python&#39;s implementation is colored by the fact that it&#39;s likely working on strings, which are expensive to copy. Instead of returning a substring of the original string to denote consumption, it works on <em>indices</em>. You pass it an index to denote where in the string the parser is currently running, and it gives you back another index to denote how much of the string it has consumed. You&#39;ll see this below.</p>

<h2>Start With The Basics</h2>

<p>At the very bottom of the library are <em>primitive parsers</em>, which succeed for very simple things. Let&#39;s write some code.</p>

<pre><code>import parsec
letter_parser = parsec.letter()
</code></pre>

<p>This is our very first parser! Let&#39;s call it in a couple different contexts.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letter_parser # What is this variable, exactly?
&lt;parsec.Parser object at 0x7f19b8a903d0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; letter_parser(&quot;abc&quot;, 0) # Success!
Value(status=True, index=1, value=&#39;a&#39;, expected=None)
&gt;&gt;&gt; letter_parser(&quot;123&quot;, 0) # Failure!
Value(status=False, index=0, value=None, expected=&#39;a letter&#39;)
</code></pre>

<p>So - when we call it on a string where it succeeds, it returns an object that contains <code>True</code>, (meaning that it succeeded) the new index of the string, the value that the parser succeeded in parsing, and an empty error string.</p>

<p>When it fails, it returns an object that contains <code>False</code>, (meaning that it failed) the new index of the string, (which, for this parser, is the same as the index that it was passed, meaning that it didn&#39;t consume anything) an empty value, and an error string.</p>

<p>Another one is <code>parsec.string</code>, which succeeds if it can consume that exact string.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also <code>parsec.regex</code>.</p>

<h3>Check for Understanding</h3>

<p>What is this?</p>

<pre><code>digit_parser = parsec.digit()
</code></pre>

<p>And when I call it on</p>

<pre><code>digit_parser(&quot;abc&quot;, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>what should I get?</p>

<h2>Combining Parsers</h2>

<p>A parser that only recognizes a single character isn&#39;t very useful, is it? <code>parsec</code> defines functions that take parsers and <strong>return other parsers</strong>. For example, <code>parsec.many</code> takes a parser <code>p</code> as an argument, and returns another parser that succeeds if it can apply <code>p</code> 0 or more times, putting the result into a list.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; many_letters = parsec.many(letter_parser)
&gt;&gt;&gt; many_letters(&quot;abc&quot;, 0)
Value(status=True, index=3, value=[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;], expected=None)
</code></pre>

<p>Another one that is important is <code>joint</code>, which allows you to combine two or more parsers into one parser that applies each parser in sequence, putting the result into a tuple.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letter_then_digit = parsec.joint(letter_parser, digit_parser)
&gt;&gt;&gt; letter_then_digit(&quot;a1xxxx&quot;, 0)
Value(status=True, index=2, value=(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;1&#39;), expected=None)
</code></pre>

<p>One more is <code>parsec.many1</code>, which is like <code>many</code> except it demands at least one successful application of <code>p</code> (meaning that unlike <code>many</code>, it can fail).</p>

<h2>Infix Operators</h2>

<p><code>joint</code> is implemented as <code>+</code>, so we can rewrite <code>letter_then_digit</code> as</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letter_then_digit = letter_parser + digit_parser
&gt;&gt;&gt; letter_then_digit(&quot;a1xxxx&quot;, 0)
Value(status=True, index=2, value=(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;1&#39;), expected=None)
</code></pre>

<p>A couple that come from Haskell are <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, which are <strong>not</strong> shift operators. Rather, they mean &quot;sequentially compose, and then ignore.&quot; The expression on the big end of the angle brackets is <strong>discarded</strong>. Thus, the following parser succeeds on 0 or more letters inside parentheses, <strong>discarding the parentheses as part of the result value</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; paren_letters = parsec.string(&quot;(&quot;) &gt;&gt; many_letters &lt;&lt; parsec.string(&quot;)&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; paren_letters(&quot;(abcd)xxxxxx&quot;, 0)
Value(status=True, index=6, value=[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;], expected=None)
</code></pre>

<h2>Mapping the Result</h2>

<p>Lists and tuples can be cumbersome. I generally want to convert them to some other value. We do that with <code>parsecmap</code>, which takes a parser <code>p</code> and a function <code>f</code> and returns another parser that calls <code>f</code> on the result.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; int_parser = parsec.parsecmap(parsec.many1(digit_parser), lambda lst: int(&#39;&#39;.join(lst)))
&gt;&gt;&gt; int_parser(&quot;123xxxx&quot;, 0)
Value(status=True, index=3, value=123, expected=None)
</code></pre>

<p>Note the integer value inside <code>value</code> - that&#39;s an integer, not a list or a string.</p>

<h3>ZALGO! ZALGO! ZALGO!</h3>

<p>The operator that&#39;s absolutely misused in the Python implementation of <code>parsec</code> is the <code>&gt;=</code> operator. This is an implementation of the &quot;bind&quot; operator <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> in Haskell, which is possibly the least descriptive name ever. <code>p &gt;= function</code> returns a parser that does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>p</code>.</li>
<li>If it succeeds, pass the resulting value to <code>function</code>, which is a function that takes the result and <em>returns another parser</em>.</li>
<li>Run that resulting parser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the following parser succeeds on <em>double letters</em>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; double_letter = letter_parser &gt;= (lambda s: parsec.parsecmap(parsec.string(s), lambda s2: f&quot;{s}{s2}&quot;))
&gt;&gt;&gt; double_letter(&quot;aa12345&quot;, 0)
Value(status=True, index=2, value=&#39;aa&#39;, expected=None)
</code></pre>

<p>If you squint hard enough, you might recognize that we&#39;ve <em>bound</em> the result of <code>letter_parser</code> to <code>s</code> inside the scope of the lambda function, hence the name of the &quot;bind&quot; operator.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t do this. Just use <code>parsec.bind</code>. It just looks <em>wrong</em> in Python.</p>

Okay, so we've described this crazy-ass library that implements parsing with a few primitive parsers. How do we actually use this in a non-trivial example?

Well, it starts easy and becomes hard!

## Literals

First off, we start with a combinator that *optionally* applies a parser, succeeding either way. This is for stuff like an optional decimal point - a float might have one, or it might not. Again, this function returns another parser:

    def opt(parser):
        return parsec.times(parser, 0, 1).parsecmap(''.join)

Next, we define our `digits` parser, which is just looking for 1 or more digits:

    def digits():
        return parsec.many1(parsec.digit()).parsecmap(''.join)

And our first actual parser that we're going to use in our program just maps the above to `int`.

    def p_integer():
        return digits().parsecmap(int)

### `p_float`

`p_float` is complicated because the Python standard allows a whole bunch of different formats. All of these are floats:

    .123
    123.45
    123.

So - `fraction` matches on a decimal point and 1 or more digits. `p_float` then has optional digits before the decimal point, plus `fraction`, **or** it is `digits` with a decimal point at the end.

`^` is **choice with backtracking**. If the first parser fails, then it backtracks to where the first parser started and runs the second parser.

### `p_literal`

Yet again, we use `^` to choose either `p_integer` or `p_float`.

## Classes

We're going to `parsecmap` parsers below this into objects that can be **evaluated**. The various `BinaryOp` subclasses define how that evaluation is done. In general, it recursively evaluates its arguments, (which themselves might be `Op`s, which recursively evaluate their own arguments or `Literal`s, which evaluate to themselves) and then applies the function on the resulting values.

Because I have the possibility of **assigning variables**, `eval` actually returns two things - a return value and a new dictionary that reflects the new variable state.

## A Context-Free Grammar

This is another academic concept - we define a *grammar* that contains *generators*, and we implement a parser for each of the generators.

The `A` term is the ""Addition"" generator, which expands to

    M + M | M - M

where `M` is the ""Multiplication"" generator. `|` implies choice. And `M` is

    E * E | E / E

where `E` is the ""Exponentiation"" generator. 

At the end of this, we have

    P -> ( A ) | literal

which can either terminate on a literal, or recurse right back to an Addition generator inside parentheses.

The rules surrounding this implement **operator precedence** - in this case, PEMDAS.

### But that's not the actual grammar!

The problem is that parser combinators, at least without additional work, cannot support *left-recursive grammars* without ambiguity. This is the classic

    x + y + z

problem - do you parse this as

    (x + y) + z

or 

    x + (y + z)

With the grammar in its current form, this is **ambiguous**. We must change our grammar to resolve this ambiguity.

We do this by adding more generators.

    A -> M A2
    A2 -> + M A2 | epsilon

""epsilon"" means ""match nothing and succeed."" So `A` can **either** be just plain `M`, or it can be `M + M (A2)` where `A2` can itself expand into `+ M (A2)`.

This means that the above `x + y + z` expression **must** be parsed as

    (x + y) + z

and the ambiguity is resolved.

## /r/restofthefuckingowl 

So, now we just write the parsers for each of the generators in our grammar.

### `many` is just `reduce`.

You'll see a couple of these:

    return p_assign(recur) ^ p_m(recur).bind(lambda e1: p_a2(recur).parsecmap(lambda l:
        functools.reduce(helper, l, e1)))

`helper` is constructing an `Op` object on two arguments. `reduce` is doing the following:

    acc = e1
    for elem in l:
        acc = helper(acc, elem)
    # result is `acc`

So this is taking, say,

    x + y + z + a

parsing the `x` into `e1`, and resolving the rest as

    [(""+"", Variable(""y"")), (""+"", Variable(""z"")), (""+"", Variable(""a""))]

and then sequentially calling `helper` on each of the elements in the list, building up a single accumulated parsed value. Thus we get

    e1 = Variable(""x"")
    e1 = Add(e1, Variable(""y"")
    e1 = Add(e1, Variable(""z""))
    e1 = Add(e1, Variable(""a""))

producing

    Add(Add(Add(Variable('x'), Variable('y')), Variable('z')), Variable('a'))

### Y Combinator Without Venture Capitalism

We perform *recursion* in our grammar - the parentheses parser goes right back to parsing `p_a`. Naively, doing this will result in a stack overflow as soon as we attempt to construct the parser.

Instead, we create a parser that *contains a reference to itself*, and pass that to the Y combinator. The result is a parser that doesn't infinitely recurse.

### Using Closures to Do This Multiple Times

`fix` only takes one argument. So, we create a *nested function* to capture the outer recursed argument and then call the Y combinator inside the scope of the function to create another recursed argument.",1673475985.0,t1_j3y1mc1,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><h1>Yak Shaving Status: Complete</h1>

This is perfectly natural and will pertain your entire life. You will always encounter something that you struggle with, even in professional programming.

Right now, you are battling two fronts: learning *a programming language* (the easier part) and learning *programming* (the difficult part).

First thing you need to understand that the above two fronts are two distinct, different things. Learning a programming language is only learning the keywords and its grammar as well as some tricks and quirks. Learning *programming* is learning to write a meaningful fully developed novel.

You need to split these two things.

You need to arrive at the point where you understand that creating the program, the *algorithm* is independent from creating the *implementation* in the programming language of your choice. Once you have an algorithm, it should be possible to implement it in more or less any programming language.

The actual code is only the final product, the end of a long train of thoughts, considerations, and compromises. It is a necessary evil because it is the only way that enables us to explain to the computer what we want it to do.

When you attack a problem, don't straight away go to the computer. Don't try to attempt to directly write code. This is not the way.

Read the problem multiple times to the point where you think you have fully understood it. Then, take a break. Do something completely different. Do something mundane. Household chores, take a walk, work out, whatever. Then, after the break read the problem again. Give your brain time to process the information.

Once you have full understanding of the problem, develop a coarse solution - as *you*, the person, would do it. Don't even think about programming it yet. Focus on the steps *you* need to take. Detail these steps. Note down every single, small step. The smaller the steps are, the more detailed they are, the better.

If you can't come up with an immediate or satisfactory solution, stop working on the problem. It is most likely that your brain needs more time to process the information. Sleep over it.

Test your steps against some sample data. Change the steps until they produce the desired outcome.

At this point, you should have a clear understanding of both, the problem and the steps you need to take to create the solution.

With the detailed steps you should be able to nearly 1:1 convert them into a program.

That's not that far off from what you do when you learn a skill. You start by reading about something, you ""think"" you understand the subject and you get confronted with practical exercice. To which you will get some wrong. 
Without a way to check your work, you won't learn, you'll just repeat mistakes and think you know your subject.

You need external input to validate your solution before being sure that what you did was actually solving a problem or not just be confidently wrong about something.

>  i don’t think you should use it to learn python though, maybe use it as someone to bounce ideas off of.

That's exactly what i've been doing the last two night. And that's why i pretty much wrote a single line of code yesterday (by myself) and kept trying to see if there wasn't other possible solution i'm unaware off that would be more elegant by bombarding chatGPT with question.

ChatGpt will try stuff with modules, functions and methods i haven't yet encountered yet. It's not teaching per see, it's showing things that exist. Copy pasting will not teach you anything, messing with it and reading about what it shows you will.

Here’s my advice: since you asked how not to be annoying, ask your senior how not to be annoying. I prefer my juniors to demonstrate they can learn. For me this means, they can ask as many questions as they want, but the next time they ask questions, I expect the questions to be different and to demonstrate that they gained some knowledge on their own. The fastest way to annoy me is to ask me the same questions over and over. However, your senior may operate differently. 

Develop your soft skills and learn how to engage with various types of people at work in a professional setting. 

Things you may want to discuss with your senior: how often your senior is ok being disturbed, do they prefer a barrage of questions at once or one by one they can answer asynchrony, is there a time of day that’s usually better for questions, what resources do they expect you to check before asking them, who else they recommend asking questions to if they are busy, etc.",0.0,t1_iz2we4k,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>You know what’s funny? Seems like all the top posts are advising you on the nitty gritty of how to ask questions. Some are saying don’t ask every question, some are saying it’s ok, etc. </p>

<p>Here’s my advice: since you asked how not to be annoying, ask your senior how not to be annoying. I prefer my juniors to demonstrate they can learn. For me this means, they can ask as many questions as they want, but the next time they ask questions, I expect the questions to be different and to demonstrate that they gained some knowledge on their own. The fastest way to annoy me is to ask me the same questions over and over. However, your senior may operate differently. </p>

<p>Get a reputation for working hard, learning, and doing good work, and nobody will deny you the answers you need. Better to ask and annoy somebody for a day than to not ask, not do your work, and then have them think you’re trash.</p>

Somewhat contrary to what others have said (and we all know what they mean but this may be confusing for beginners), JavaScript already has types.  So saying TypeScript is JavaScript with types doesn't really help imho.

let status = true; // Sets the value of status to true which is a boolean

let name = ""Dave""; // Sets the value of name to Dave which is a string

cost user = { ""status"": true, ""name"": ""Dave"" }; // Sets the value of user to an object.

There are 8 types in total.  7 primative (undefined, null, bool, number, bigInt, string, symbol) and 1 compound (object, of which functions and arrays are special types of).

So JavaScript has types.  But notice that no type was explicitly declared in the code. The JavaScript engine does this for us. JavaScript also enables us to change the type of whatever is initially assigned.  This can result in various bugs.

status = ""true""; // Status is now set to be a string.  This is fine...but could cause sutlbe bugs if the type is being relied upon later.

Some developers prefer to work with statically typed languages.  This means that types can be explicitly set in the code and can't be changed.

This is what TypeScript introduces.

let status: boolean = true;

Now status is explicitly set to a boolean and typescript will tell you when something attempts to change it.  This way you can be sure in future that status is and remains a boolean.

One other important thing to understand is that TypeScript isn't really a separate language.  It is a superset that is compiled down to JavaScript.

If you want to know more in a beginner friendly way this is a good place to start: https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/

Each time a symbol is created it is guaranteed to be different from all others.

Imagine a random number generator, but the number is always different from any other number generated, and you can't see the number, and it may not be a number, and you can't change it.  All you know is that it is unique.

<p>Plus the university graduates tend to have other interests that they&#39;ve studied in the process of garnering the electives they need to graduate. I was considering a project that would require us to determine an appropriate projection for custom map regions, then place location identifiers on those maps taking into account the projection. One of my programmers said, &quot;No problem. I studied cartography in school.&quot; Another time we needed to translate the program into Spanish and were looking into translation services when one of my English-speaking programmers said, &quot;I can just do that myself.&quot; Turns out he was fluent. Who knew.</p>

***They want to improve their chances of landing a job***

Sure, you don’t need a degree to land a programming job, but having a degree does improve your chances. 

***They want to develop their skills***

A computer science degree isn’t focused on programming but theory. The material you learn from a computer science degree will help improve your skills as a programmer in your job. 

***They want to fill in their gaps***

Self-teaching will most likely cause one to have gaps in their knowledge, and getting a computer science degree is a great way to fill in those gaps. 

***They want to move into a roel that requires a degree***

Some roles require you to have a degree, and you can’t get them or it’s gonna to be extremely hard to without a degree. 

***It’s a better use of their time***

Getting a computer science degree can be a better use of their time vs trial & error with self-teaching. 

###Computer Science Degree option via WGU

With schools like WGU which allow one to get a a Bachelor’s in Computer Science in less than 4 years, and for a lot less money compared to a traditional university; the idea of getting a computer science degree isn’t that bad. 

- Example: One can get a BS in Computer Science from WGU in ~12 months or less for ~$8k or less.

###My Experience 

I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Art in 2022. I spent time after working my full-time job studying programming, JavaScript, then applied for an internal posting for a programming role at my job. I passed the interview & got the job, but I knew I needed to improve a lot after my interview. 

After being in my role for a few months, I still knew I had a lot to learn & gaps in my knowledge. So, after a few months I started looking into getting a BS in Computer Science or Software Engineering from WGU.

Leaving failing the defense aside (as then one really sucks in his knowledge and skills) then with quitting before the thesis or before the defense can still leave the person with all the knowledge and skills he acquired during his studies.

So, a degree alone does not really help. Sure, in some places an ability to show that paper/title can be helpful. But in general your own knowledge and skills matter.

>Have 5-10+ years of experience in scalable, multi-tenant environments.  
Have 2+ years experience tech leading teams, including helping scope and breakdown work

That is from a job a recruiter reached out to me with on linked in. It pays a base of 200+ but the whole description mentions nothing about any type of degree. I turned it down because it's a lead on a smaller team of just 6 people. The point is that if you see a company that won't hire or promote you because you don't have a college degree then run and never look back.

One industry secret that people don't know is that a college degree becomes irrelevant after the first few years because everyone has had a chance to prove their actual real-world productivity and skills by then.

With 3 years of experience, my advice is for you to continue upskilling yourself. You should be aiming to become a senior in the next 2 years if you aren't one already.   


Below are just a few tips and skills that I think you should already know or take the time to know. It doesn't matter if you identify yourself as a front-end or backend engineer at a senior level you should have a working to expert level of some of the following.

&#x200B;

* Data structures and algorithms - The level of depth you go into depends on your company or your own goals.
* HTTP/S - Types of requests, headers, cookies, caching, error codes, etc.
* Authentication and authorization - Oauth, JWTs, sessions, SAML etc
* Authentication and authorization - Oauth, JWTs, sessions, SAML, etc
* Browser developer tools.
* Software design patterns - SOLID etc
* Unit and integration testing.
* Build tools - Linters, CI/CD 
* Application observability and monitoring - Splunk etc.

Since you already have your foot in the door, keeping up with new technology and going deeper into what you already know will keep you relevant forever.",0.0,t1_j5qy6iw,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>I wouldn&#39;t sweat it especially if you are already in. Don&#39;t waste your time doing 4 years of college at this point. I am now a principal engineer leading 3 different teams for a total of 24 engineers without a computer science degree. </p>

<p>If you read most job descriptions they now say a degree or equivalent experience. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have 5-10+ years of experience in scalable, multi-tenant environments.<br/>
Have 2+ years experience tech leading teams, including helping scope and breakdown work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is from a job a recruiter reached out to me with on linked in. It pays a base of 200+ but the whole description mentions nothing about any type of degree. I turned it down because it&#39;s a lead on a smaller team of just 6 people. The point is that if you see a company that won&#39;t hire or promote you because you don&#39;t have a college degree then run and never look back.</p>

The `return` keyword serves, generally, two purposes:

Firstly, it ""sends back"" some value at the end of a function's run. Remember that ""functions"" in programming are basically pre-packaged, re-runnable bits of code that you can call whenever you want. So, for example, we have a (paraphrased!) method in my company's codebase named `removeMillisecondsFromTimestamp()`. Since, in a lot of places, we don't explicitly *care* about milliseconds, this function simply takes a timestamp and rounds the seconds down to the nearest integer. So this function takes an input ('2023-01-20T07:37:50.1234Z'), and *returns* that value without its millisecond fraction ('2023-01-20T07:37:50Z'). Above all, this allows you to use the *result* of that function elsewhere in your code.

Secondly, the return keyword often *stops* that run of that function at that keyword. So, for example, consider the following function which will divide *a* by *b*, but only if *a* \> *b*:

    public static double DivideOnlyGreaterThanZero(double a, double b) {
        if ( b <= a) {
            return 0;//Yes, this isn't mathematically correct.
        }
        return a/b;
    }

In this example, if *a* is less than *b*, we don't wanna bother dividing. We simply wanna return the number `0` and... stop using that function. In that case, we return 0, and don't even hit the `return a/b;` line.

Not to sound cliche, but the only dumb questions in programming are the ones you don't ask. Of course, it's your job to put in every effort to understand the answers you get (...as long as the answers don't suck!), and if you're asking the same question of the same person 3+ times, then you need to rephrase that question.

Remember that &quot;functions&quot; in programming are basically pre-packaged, re-runnable bits of code that you can call whenever you want.

<p>In this example, if <em>a</em> is less than <em>b</em>, we don&#39;t wanna bother dividing. We simply wanna return the number <code>0</code> and... stop using that function. In that case, we return 0, and don&#39;t even hit the <code>return a/b;</code> line.</p>

1. Public: Make this function available to stuff outside this class
2. Static: This function exists on the class itself (as opposed to instances of the class). Don't worry too much if this doesn't make sense for now.
3. Double: This function *must return a value of type ""double""*. 
4. Is named DivideOnlyGreaterThanZero. So if I call (""use"") the function, I use that name.
5. Has two inputs of type ""double""

Some languages like JavaScript are loose or weakly typed, which basically means that you can mix and match variable types largely at will. That *can* leave you in hot water, tho. Imagine the following:

    function additonalCostForUserFromDatabase(user, initialCost) {
        initialCost += getAdditionalCost(user);
        return initialCost;
    }
    additonalCostForUserFromDatabase('HealyUnit', 5);

Now, let's imagine that for whatever reason, the above function can't *find* the user passed to it. Let's assume that that `getAdditionalCost()` function returns the string ""not found!"" if it can't find that user. That entire function would basically be trying to add 5 and ""not found!"". If you're scratching your head at this point... Yes. That's sort of the point.

With an earlier compiler.

That first compiler was used to compile the second compiler, and so on.

That solves the gcc paradox. The first version of gcc was *not* compiled using gcc! That would have been impossible. But gcc was not the first C compiler. C compilers already existed.

When you invent a new language it requires an extra step: for example, the first version of the Rust compiler was written in another language, OCaml. Then once that worked, they rewrote the Rust compiler in Rust and compiled it again.

If you can understand that a program can take input (like the string Hello World) and produce output, like reversing the string, conceptually a compiler is just the same. The rules are just more complicated than reverse the input.

And writing a basic compiler isn't that big of a project TBH. There's a bunch of tutorials online, but if you want a fully compliant and fast compiler that outputs optimized code that's gonna take a bit of effort.

https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html

As for writing a compiler in it's own language that's noting special.

They have an alphabet of valid characters, and they have a grammar that dictates how those characters can be sequenced to produce ""grammatically correct sentence"".

The first stage in compilation is parsing. The compiler reads the source code character by character and uses the rules of grammar to construct an abstract representation of the language.

The result is usually some kind of tree-like structure (called Abstract Syntax Tree). The branches in that tree are expressions/statements usually identified by some operator, with sub-branches that represent the sub-expressions.

For example, this: `a+10*c` might get turned into a tree like this:

    BinaryOperation{
        operator: Addition,
        left_hand_side:
             Variable(""a""),

            right_hand_side: Variable(""c""),
        } 
    }

&#x200B;

Second stage in compilation is code generation. The compiler walks the tree (usually in depth-first order) and generates appropriate code for each branch in the tree. The output of this second stage is the machine code, or some other intermediate representation (for example bytecode) that may be further processed or interpreted.

>And how is it possible that some compilers like gcc are written in the same language that they compile?

A compiler is just a program that takes source code as an input, and outputs the corresponding machine code. A compiler can be written in itself - you just feed its own (possibly modified) source code into it, and it spits out a (possibly modified) copy of itself.

Off course, this means that the first version of the compiler must have been written in some other language. This is a process called bootstrapping. You can follow the genealogy of a language and its compilers/interpreters all the way back to earliest compilers that were written directly in machine code.",0.0,t1_j3ii1ko,False,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>The first thing you need to understand is that programming languages are languages.

Even though I wouldn’t consider this a “beginner” task, based on some of your other replies, im going to assume that you know how to program and you are familiar with python at a decent level.

Look into [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification) with keras. Check out convolutional neural networks (CNN). These are used frequently for image classification problems like you described. I won’t explain them here, but the documentation is pretty clear and there’s a lot of literature out there on this stuff.

You have to get a lot of data too though. Ideally, you’ll want to find an existing dataset for images of clothing along with labels of weather, but that might not be possible. I can tell you the clothing images data is real. That’s a common one. The weather labels you might have to come up with on your own for the clothing images. So start small, consider only a few different kinds of weather, like “rainy” vs “sunny”. Find all the clothing images that make sense for each of those & label them with the appropriate one. 

Once you have these, the images of clothing and the labels of weather, you want to combine them into one dataset. You’re going to want to set aside most of the data for “training” and the smaller portion left over for “testing”. Here’s the idea, in the training phase, you’ll feed your training data (combination of images and labels) into your model NN (neural net), it’s going to come up with a strategy for how to guess the label of the weather, given the image of clothing. Meaning the image of clothing will be your independent variable and the label of weather will be your dependent one. In the testing phase, you’ll give only the images of clothing from that smaller portion of data you reserved that the model did not see before, and it’s going to use its training strategy to try to guess the label of the weather from the new image. All of the models predictions then will be compared to the ‘actual’ labels of weather for that smaller portion, and you’ll see how well it does in terms of “accuracy” as well as other metrics.

Ok here’s the thing to remember though. This is the ML/DL side of things. If you want this to be interactive as in real time you show an image of clothing and it guesses the weather, then it needs to be able to ‘capture’ the data somehow. 
There are libraries out there that use computer vision for image detection. This could be helpful. 
You need to have the computer take a picture of the clothing it’s shown. Then with that picture, assuming your NN is trained with many images of pictures, the NN will make a ‘guess’ on that new picture, and then that result will have to render somehow so that the user can see. 

For example, I show the computer a raincoat then a second goes by and the computer displays a label ‘rainy’ to me. So here, the computer has to first get the new data - the picture of my raincoat - then it needs to take that data & hand it over to the NN behind the scenes that’s been trained to predict weather labels given clothing images - the model will come up with some kind of weather label prediction and that prediction needs to be sent back to the user interface - then whatever the model guessed will be displayed on the computer so the user can see it.

Now you might ask, what about those new images though, are they stored somewhere? That’s up to you. You could put those images into a database. And store them, then periodically retrain your NN so it keeps learning patterns and gets better at making predictions (in theory). However, with each of those new pictures taken you’d need to go through and come up with all the true labels for the weather so that when you train it’s able to base its strategy around making weather label predictions (classifications). This could be really tedious. 

I’d start small with all this stuff though. I would focus on MVP for each. Make the NN model
simple. Consider [transfer learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-pre-trained-cnn-models-to-use-for-computer-vision-with-transfer-learning-885cb1b2dfc) using a pretrained NN for image classification even. For transfer learning here’s an example of using google’s pretrained [MobileNetV2](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning) model in combination with training data from ImageNet, a massive image dataset with labels, to predict dogs and cats. Also make the app to collect the ‘image’ from the user simple. Then try to connect the two. The image from the user needs to go into the NN. The prediction from the NN needs to go back to the user. The user comes first, they show the picture, the NN predicts on the picture, then you show that prediction in a human like way back to the user. You’ll be glueing stuff together. Once you got this down for a basic one, then I’d say move on if you want to make it more involved (multi-label classification, tuning, storage/retrain, etc). 

Idk if you’ve seen that show Silicon Valley ever, there’s an episode where one of the guys makes an app to determine if something is a hot dog or not given a picture, it’s probably similar to this tbh. The model behind the scenes was probably trained in a binary classification way, where it was given a bunch of images & then labels of ‘hotdog’ and ‘not hotdog’ appropriately made for each image, then with each new image taken by the user, that was given to the model so it can predict if it’s a hotdog or not, and then the app rendered its prediction as “hotdog” or “not hotdog” on the UI. So maybe see that episode I’m talking about, look @ that app and how it works, and then you’ll get an idea of how your thing could work from a user standpoint.

I can tell you the clothing images data is real. That’s a common one. The weather labels you might have to come up with on your own for the clothing images. So start small, consider only a few different kinds of weather, like “rainy” vs “sunny”. Find all the clothing images that make sense for each of those &amp; label them with the appropriate one. </p>

<p>Once you have these, the images of clothing and the labels of weather, you want to combine them into one dataset. You’re going to want to set aside most of the data for “training” and the smaller portion left over for “testing”. Here’s the idea, in the training phase, you’ll feed your training data (combination of images and labels) into your model NN (neural net), it’s going to come up with a strategy for how to guess the label of the weather, given the image of clothing. Meaning the image of clothing will be your independent variable and the label of weather will be your dependent one. In the testing phase, you’ll give only the images of clothing from that smaller portion of data you reserved that the model did not see before, and it’s going to use its training strategy to try to guess the label of the weather from the new image. All of the models predictions then will be compared to the ‘actual’ labels of weather for that smaller portion, and you’ll see how well it does in terms of “accuracy” as well as other metrics.</p>

<p>Ok here’s the thing to remember though. This is the ML/DL side of things. If you want this to be interactive as in real time you show an image of clothing and it guesses the weather, then it needs to be able to ‘capture’ the data somehow. 
There are libraries out there that use computer vision for image detection. This could be helpful. 
You need to have the computer take a picture of the clothing it’s shown. Then with that picture, assuming your NN is trained with many images of pictures, the NN will make a ‘guess’ on that new picture, and then that result will have to render somehow so that the user can see. </p>

<p>For example, I show the computer a raincoat then a second goes by and the computer displays a label ‘rainy’ to me. So here, the computer has to first get the new data - the picture of my raincoat - then it needs to take that data &amp; hand it over to the NN behind the scenes that’s been trained to predict weather labels given clothing images - the model will come up with some kind of weather label prediction and that prediction needs to be sent back to the user interface - then whatever the model guessed will be displayed on the computer so the user can see it.</p>

<p>Now you might ask, what about those new images though, are they stored somewhere? That’s up to you. You could put those images into a database. And store them, then periodically retrain your NN so it keeps learning patterns and gets better at making predictions (in theory). However, with each of those new pictures taken you’d need to go through and come up with all the true labels for the weather so that when you train it’s able to base its strategy around making weather label predictions (classifications). This could be really tedious. </p>

<p>I’d start small with all this stuff though. I would focus on MVP for each. Make the NN model
simple. Consider <a href=""https://towardsdatascience.com/4-pre-trained-cnn-models-to-use-for-computer-vision-with-transfer-learning-885cb1b2dfc"">transfer learning</a> using a pretrained NN for image classification even. For transfer learning here’s an example of using google’s pretrained <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning"">MobileNetV2</a> model in combination with training data from ImageNet, a massive image dataset with labels, to predict dogs and cats. Also make the app to collect the ‘image’ from the user simple. Then try to connect the two. The image from the user needs to go into the NN. The prediction from the NN needs to go back to the user. The user comes first, they show the picture, the NN predicts on the picture, then you show that prediction in a human like way back to the user. You’ll be glueing stuff together. Once you got this down for a basic one, then I’d say move on if you want to make it more involved (multi-label classification, tuning, storage/retrain, etc). </p>

<p>Idk if you’ve seen that show Silicon Valley ever, there’s an episode where one of the guys makes an app to determine if something is a hot dog or not given a picture, it’s probably similar to this tbh. The model behind the scenes was probably trained in a binary classification way, where it was given a bunch of images &amp; then labels of ‘hotdog’ and ‘not hotdog’ appropriately made for each image, then with each new image taken by the user, that was given to the model so it can predict if it’s a hotdog or not, and then the app rendered its prediction as “hotdog” or “not hotdog” on the UI. So maybe see that episode I’m talking about, look @ that app and how it works, and then you’ll get an idea of how your thing could work from a user standpoint. </p>

<p>Anyway, hopefully that gave you some ideas</p>

This code checks for the existence of s3. If s3 doesn’t exist it will return the logical and of s1 and s2’s existence. From then it will recursively check the equality between s1 and s3 and s2 and s3. I went ahead and somewhat tested this to make sure my post had some reason. It checks for s3’s existence because it will recurse into itself and make s3 smaller as well as s2 and s1. Basically, this code will check to make sure that s3 is the “largest” of the strings you input and that the strings are identical. It checks that s1 is the shortest string and that s2 is shorter than s3. It also checks that the strings are identical up until where they end. An example: 

s1 = “te”
s2 = “tes” 
s3 = “test”

This is acceptable output. The following is not accepted by the script: 

s1 = “test” 
s2 = “tes” 
s3 = “te”

Now I see why it’s called combined order in that it checks for the order of the strings as well as string equality. 

Every time s1[1:] is called s1 has its first element removed. In this way the script recursively calls itself until s1 is expended and returns true (if the strings were equal up to that point) or false, or until s3 is expended and the whole script ends up returning false.

> When using C++ I'd sometimes run into the problem where my programs can't handle large numbers because C++ just doesn't have anything larger than 64-bit numbers (128 on some compilers). So it'd just output 0 or infinity.

Infinity is not a valid value for unsigned or two's complement signed integers. It is a valid value for floats but that's not what we're talking about. Overflow is technically undefined behavior in C++ so it could do whatever it wants, but generally it'll wrap back around to negative numbers.

The Python part of this answer was correct for Python 2, but not for Python 3 (which came out 14 years ago now). In Python 3, there is only one Integer type, int, which is arbitrary size. The Java answer is completely wrong - the `int` type in Java is a 32-bit signed integer.

Ex: Dr. Logic teaches many students at the university of science. He has so many students, he figures he can come up with a program to compute their grades. Given a numerical “grade” he would like to have the appropriate letter grade given back according to the university’s plus or minus scale where: 

         A+ : 97-100
         A: 93-96
         A-: 90-92
         B+: 87-89
         B: 83-86
         B-: 80-83
         C+: 77-79
         C: 73-76
         C-: 70-72
         F: below 70

In addition, Dr. Logic is favorably bias towards freshman. Any freshman in his class gets a 10 point curve (positive). Any other student however, gets no such benefit. Given a numerical grade and a ranking outlining the year for a student in Dr. Logic’s course, return the appropriate letter grade. 

         input: 60 “Freshman”
         output: C-
         Freshman get 10 point curves. 
         60+10 = 70. This is a C-

         input: 60 “Sophomore”
         output: F
         Anyone not a freshman gets no curve.
         60 is below 70. This is F 

Ex: Happy days are those that are sunny, on a weekend [saturday / sunday], or occur on an even date. Sad days are those that are rainy, on a weekday, or occur on an odd date. Given a string representing a label of “weather”, “day”, or “date”, and a weather (str), day (str), date (str) return whether it’s a happy day or sad day. 

          input: “day” “Saturday”
          output: “happy”
          Saturday is on the weekend its happy. 

          input: “date” “21”
          output: “sad”
          21 is an odd date, it’s sad. 

          input: “weather” “sunny”
          output: “happy”
          Sunny days are happy. 
          

Ex: Mark Wahlberg has saved the city of Boston thousands of times. Without him, Boston would not exist. However, the city cannot call upon his help without knowing for sure if he’s needed.

I am not worried of these tools replacing my job, because that would be like worrying that the tools writers use to correct grammar and auto complete some sentences will replace writers. What we do as software engineers is not churn out the same code for a basic app over and over. We solve problems with software. A lot of times that requires understanding a bunch of things that have nothing to do with the code base we are touching.</p>
