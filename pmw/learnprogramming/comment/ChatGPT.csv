This is absolutely not the same.

Firstly they are excellent practice to really nail down fundamentals. Algorithms must be correctly coded or they won't work. Writing them practices your edge-case testing and knowledge of references, loops, conditionals etc.

But you would if you were trying to _build_ one. 

Or, another way to look at things: you don't necessarily need to know how a power tool works to use it. But if I hand you a box of 20 power tools, and you have _zero_ knowledge of what they are or how they work, then you might as well not have any, since it's just a big box of options for you.

The ""low-code/no-code"" thing is about reducing the number of tools in the box and automating their use. It lets you do things like building a website or creating a dashboard or creating an automated workflow, but it doesn't give you the same kind of freedom as writing code does. By intention. They are all tools that are constrained to solving very narrow problems, so that the user doesn't need a large background of programming to solve that particular class of problems.

And they're good enough for the problems they're solving. But they can't replace programmers entirely (and not just in the sense that someone has to program the tools, there are plenty of areas where they just can't do the job).

>I don't doubt whether there are some people that still need to understand those internals, but... am I that person?

If you're writing custom code, then yes, you are that person. This isn't even something that you have to know to the level of academic study. You need a good working understanding of the basic data structures (because you'll likely have to build some custom ones based on the fundamental ones), and a basic understanding of algorithm analysis. You need to be able to look at an algorithm and determine its worst-case runtime. This enables you to make smarter choices up-front.

Simple example: being presented with two datasets, you need to find matches between them. Without a DS&A background, you might think ""two nested loops"". With a DS&A background, you understand that such an algorithm's runtime grows quadratically based on the sizes of the input, and if the datasets are large enough, will require an alternative, more efficient approach. Without that background, you might not even think to ask the AI about a more efficient approach until you do the work and eventually test it against huge data.

<p>Or, another way to look at things: you don&#39;t necessarily need to know how a power tool works to use it.

ChatGPT is just a tool. It’s not going to replace anybody in itself. You still need a human to use and interpret it’s results. 

If an employer needs a competent engineer - they’re gonna make sure they’re hiring someone who knows their stuff. It doesn’t matter if Google exists or AI. 

Also, nobody can predict how AI will shape the future. True AI won’t exist likely in our lifetime or if it’s even possible to begin with. 

So you’re only hurting yourself by being scared to study algorithms because you think in 10 years you’ll be replaced. It sounds to me more like you’re too lazy to bother with algorithms because there’s a small chance you won’t need it in years. That’s absurd.

It sounds like you’ve never worked in an enterprise application. Adding features can be complicated and many many many times you’ll have to write your own logic, as in your own algorithms to make the feature do what you intend it to. So you’re only hurting your own programming skills. 

What do you think programming is if it isn’t writing algorithms all the time? Algorithms aren’t only to manipulate data. It’s a broad term that can apply in many areas where you try to achieve a result. Try adding a feature in an enterprise application with hundredths of files and dependencies and coupled code.

What ChatGPT (and other AIs) can do, is to create all the standard, basic ""pizza""-code that you build your application on. If you are creating a web-application, chances are that you are going to need a backend, store some data in a database, convert data-tables into objects, transfer those to the frontend through some REST-API, create a frontend to receive data, display data in lists, and create forms to edit those data. And that's before adding any business-logic to the application!

This is boring work, really repetitive, but not so repetitive that you can re-use code from earlier projects. Of course you have to learn how to do it, in order to ask ChatGPT to do it for you, and fix all the mistakes it makes - and that part of learning might seem a bit annoying, like learning multiplication-tables when you have a calculator. But once you get to use it actively, and can work on more interesting code, it will be amazing!

Some ""code-monkey""-jobs, where you only ever create this basic code, they are going to disappear, and the bootcamps that only teach to that level, they are going to close, or level up.

Now, I don't really use it to write production code. It is way too eager to invent non-existing functions and give you overall wrong solutions. It is not reliable enough whatsoever.

What I do use it for is to criticize my code, and apply those criticisms.

Another use case is to generate tests. In TDD I can give it a method definition and what I want the end result to be, and it'll generate a bunch of different tests - including potential edge cases. It isn't perfect, but its often good enough. I often refactor the tests a little, but it means I start out with a very suite of tests before implementation*.

From what you said, I'd go for ML here, in particular if it goes into things like evaluating problems for suitability for ML, limitations and pitfalls, and how ML is actually used in business applications. Testing is kinda meh and crypto is useful, but moreso if you're wanting to go into cybersecurity.

>Elective-2 we have 1) Artificial Intelligence and deep learning. 2) Management and Entrepreneurship. 3)Cyber security and cyber laws.

You could double down on AI, but that class looks to be more specific but may also be more of the science and math behind it, so the management class sounds like a good fit for you. Again, security mainly if you're interested in cybersecurity.

>Elective-1 we have 1) Big Data. 2) Agile software process. 3) Ethical hacking.

Big Data is an incredibly useful skill for both development and business for data-oriented industries (tech, finance, etc). If this sounds awful to you or you're much more interested in the day to day running of a software team, agile process could also be good. You said you weren't interested in hacking.

>Elective-2 we have 1)Software project management. 2) Virtual Reality and augmented reality. 3)Internet of things.

As an experiment, I just asked it ""What makes Python 3 backwards incompatible with Python 2?"" and got the following response:

> 1. Print statement is replaced by print() function: In Python 2, the print statement is used to print to the standard output, while in Python 3, the print() function is used.

> 2. Division operator: In Python 2, the division operator (/) behaves differently depending on the type of the operands. If the operands are both integers, it performs floor division, while if either operand is a float, it performs true division. In Python 3, the division operator always performs true division, regardless of the type of the operands.

> 3. Exception handling: In Python 2, the syntax for handling exceptions is different from Python 3. In Python 2, the except clause must specify the exception class, while in Python 3, it can specify the exception class or exception instance.

> 4. Unicode support: Python 3 has improved support for Unicode, with all strings being Unicode by default. In Python 2, Unicode support is optional and must be explicitly enabled.

Of those four bullet points, #1 is basically correct. #2 is *sort of* correct, but worded much too strongly -- in *both* Python 2 and 3, the result of the `/` and `//` operators depends (in general) on the types of the operands, and the only thing that was changed in Python 3 was the behavior for `int`s. #3 is totally wrong. And #4 is half-correct, but saying Unicode support is ""optional"" in Python 2 is very poor phrasing. You don't ""enable"" it; it's always enabled, and you *use* it by constructing `unicode` objects.

The second skill would require the first skill. If you don't understand the algorithm, then you're not qualified to judge whether or not the AI produced useful output.

This always reminds me of students in mathematics classes asking ""why do we have to learn this when a calculator can give us the answers?"" And frankly, the teachers back in my day gave bad reasoning: ""because you won't always have a calculator!"" And of course, they were wrong. Everyone carries a powerful computer in their pocket these days. 

But the important part is that learning the underlying theory of algorithms makes you capable of identifying when such an algorithm would be useful. Going back to the math class example, understanding the formulae we learned meant we could identify scenarios where such would apply. Just having a calculator to give us the answer is useful once we know to apply the formula, but without that understanding, a calculator might as well be a brick for how much it would help.

Same for algorithms and AI. Sure, it's great if you _know_ what algorithm to use, but if you don't have that kind of background, _you aren't qualified_ to judge if the response is valid or useful.

My suggestion: don't look for ways to avoid learning important fundamentals. It's not about myopia or gatekeeping. Yes, AI is a tool that is here to stay.

But you would if you were trying to _build_ one. 

Or, another way to look at things: you don't necessarily need to know how a power tool works to use it. But if I hand you a box of 20 power tools, and you have _zero_ knowledge of what they are or how they work, then you might as well not have any, since it's just a big box of options for you.

The ""low-code/no-code"" thing is about reducing the number of tools in the box and automating their use. It lets you do things like building a website or creating a dashboard or creating an automated workflow, but it doesn't give you the same kind of freedom as writing code does. By intention.

If you're writing custom code, then yes, you are that person. This isn't even something that you have to know to the level of academic study. You need a good working understanding of the basic data structures (because you'll likely have to build some custom ones based on the fundamental ones), and a basic understanding of algorithm analysis. You need to be able to look at an algorithm and determine its worst-case runtime. This enables you to make smarter choices up-front.

Simple example: being presented with two datasets, you need to find matches between them. Without a DS&A background, you might think ""two nested loops"". With a DS&A background, you understand that such an algorithm's runtime grows quadratically based on the sizes of the input, and if the datasets are large enough, will require an alternative, more efficient approach. Without that background, you might not even think to ask the AI about a more efficient approach until you do the work and eventually test it against huge data.
